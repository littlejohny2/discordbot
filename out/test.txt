it’s really strange because she takes it far more seriously than me
shelby said the r slur on call
I will never forgive women for prohibition
both of these things are true
shelby does not have object permanence

incorrect.
wrong.
no.
but they bathed me when I was littol
I don’t think I ever bathed with my parents either
yeah
what
both of you showered with your parents
then shower
then bath by yourself
but the natural progression is that
like when I was really little I was bathed in a bath by my parents
younger obviously
not recently
shelby n
have you ever showered with your dad
shelby
since a child??
regularly?
once or twice is a shameful secret a lot of people have
you and kyle are a minority
less than 9% of people regularly piss in the shower
shelby said when she was a kid she was jealous of people who got to per standing up
what
you do realize how strange
Dried off
I’ve always gotten out on a mat
?
it’s that easy
so I don’t track water ever
that i lay down before showering
I have a mat
oh my god
it’s the warm water
is a reminder
showering
just piss
you procrastinate on pissing??
use the bathroom before hand
what I do every time
shelby
none of this is a joke
this is awful
Shelby’s saying she spreads her legs
she’s been doing to the day
shelby’s dad when she was little told her to piss in the shower
someone share my horror
I’m gonna cry

shelby JUST SAID THE R SLUR

I blamed her for something she didn’t do for a bit
I actually made shelby so angry she yelled at me with zero joking
she was eating ice cream on top of pasta

what did you put down for someone as worthy as MLK
and the substitute asked blake
since we also had an accompanying poem on him
and part of the assignment was naming someone you thought was worthy of a poem too
we were doing the regular assignment on the I have a dream speech by mlk
imagine how much of a brainwashed bootlicker you must be to say trump is on the same level as martin luther fucking king junior
***oh god i felt mlk rolling in his grave***
***yeah***

and what was that question
who said trump for that one question
im sorry but please remind me shelby
***president trump***
how can racist
literally MLK existed and won everything he was fighting for
look
if we had a black president then they're just making excuses
TRUEEE
it can even be taken away with a black acquaintance
i mean hey
same with homophobia
racist status is immediately taken away with colored friends
i mean i thought shelby was being serious
its like how you cant be racist with black friends
you obviously cant be homophobic with gay friends

https://youtu.be/SyBbAEMhv7o

there that is
anywho
what a loser
unlike skipper
what a champion
i know


a final overlook
yeah go for it
what a game
obama wins the fourth gunger hame


who will win
what will it come down to
and **He**
obama
kepler
night four
ladies and gentlemen


kyle just freezes to death
day 4

ronald being sliced may have killed him
actually you may be
day 4
and now has an infection
obama was prickled by that bush
just injures i think
nope
obama tries to treat his infection
as a warning
slices her
noticing shelby
kyle
night rolls about


obama do be fishin
kepler finds him and takes him down
due to the pigeon screaming incredibly loudly

from a distance
shelby following kyle

day 3 comes about
and obama hums within the bushes
screams for help
not seeing any gunger hames go this fast
the pigeon
night 2 rolls in

indeed
and shelby
**He**
kyle
ben
obama
the pigeon

day 2 concludes
and finally gives in
chase just not being able to take the slaughter of earlier

obama hides among the bushes
killing him immediately
the pigeon flies into ben

uncharacteristic for chase
kepler, chase, and the pigeon confronting yet deescalating
obama has been doing good for himself
absolutely brutal
obama killing garfield with a sickle

the center is replenished
the second day

to cook food
using his superior facts and logic
and bencil
questioning things
kepler
garfield sleeps

comforting each other by the moonlight
a large group of contestants

following the massacre of the first day
the first night
but no other cat
i added a cat
sand cat isnt in the game
than dead ones
we officially have less alive candidates
district 10
and round bear
district 2
joe biden
district 8
everest

the last three
finally
district 3
and biggy cheese
district 7
a cat
district 6
rebuild femboy hooters

district 12
and fumbledore
district 9
anti mask protester
district 4
jared

district 9
covid 19
district 5
donald trump
district 12
divorced ron

miranda
and
district 1
cool jesus
from district 5
we have skipper

**15** cannon shots ring out
where we honor the fallen tributes
and this is the section
ideally
until all but one is eliminated
as many days as needed
nope
this has all been the first day by the way
so many dead the first day
and it was in the wrong direction
and couldnt stop
in fact he started rolling
truly
too large to recover from the trip
and the round bear
trips and dies
over 100 probably
joe biden

brutal tactics
ben shapiro
biggy cheese dead
into the border
along with her own
shelby leads the cat to her death
in some stupid idea

and was claimed by the border
then passed out
he like walked a few steps away from the center
fumbledore literally does not know whats going on
along the with anti-mask protester
i trip and die

the border in fact cures covid
covid 19 is dead
killing trump
obama

we are about to see a lot of deaths
so early into the game
an arena event

and what do we have
perhaps the beginning to something?
and obama tends to garfield
a cat goes around pouncing on the bugs she sees
the everest and chase pairing being a strong one
kepler, everest, chase, and covid 19 hunt

searches for water
the pigeon, having food
you havent done anything of note
and such
like running away
i just dont include more menial things
you have
starts to hunt
and logic
bencil, overcoming his feelings with facts

the first day begins
yet doest end his life
which isnt too hard considering he is just stumbling around
shelby slices ronald
meanwhile in apparently a sudden personality change
and murders him
locks onto the most egregious thing
despite being confused as to whats happening
joe biden

and kills him
rolls onto jesus
girthy round bear
and the massive
a fight occurs

and is scared away
bencil sharpeniro lets feelings overcome facts
knows food is essential
being a hardened veteran
the pigeon

cant take the guilt of betraying obama
like before he steps off his little platform
skipper literally just kills himself as soon as the games starts

and the very first event
until each of them are eliminated but one
basically random events happen to the characters
hames
or might i say
and the games are afoot
the horn sounds
they could possibly take winning place
now if they are able to wake up from their drunken stupor
Dysfunctional Hogwarts

yet most classic pairing
our last
and finally
we shall see what kepler can do in the game
and kepler
**He**

probably our most enigmatic couple
now in district 11
garfield
paired with the funniest cat alive
an absolute unit of a bear
we have our animal pairing

in district 10
we shall see
will covid rack up a kill count?
and covid 19 itself
an anti-mask protester
district 9
and we have probably the most unlikely, or likely, pairing so far
if they work together
perhaps a pairing to be reckoned with
Chase and Everest
we have the paw patrol grouping

in district 8
its just a dude and a sweet cat
in district 7, probably the most content pairing we have

time will tell what REBUILD FEMBOY HOOTERS and shen bapiro will do
we have yet another uneasy pairing
and in district 6

after turning his back on obama
skipper is now supporting the current sitting president Donald Trump
in a legendary betrayal

and in district 5
but they could end up working together when forced to
a very uneasy pairing
jared and Lip Bitin' Miranda

in the fourth district
we all shall wonder what biggy cheese will do in these games
our kaiser and biggy cheese

in the third district
now deciding to toss their lives into the gunger hames
once political companions
obama and mr biden

over in the second district
and the pigeon is coming back again for glory
after being resurrected he decided to get himself back into the game
the pigeon teaming up with jesus himself

over in the first district we have a pairing of winner and loser
we have a lot of returning characters as well as a few interesting new ones
now would be the time to come back online
if you wish to observe the fourth gunger hames
ladies and gentlemens
because sometimes the links from other websites are unreliable
weeg i have a imgur account where i just upload all the pictures to and then direct link them
unless there are unforseen problems
nearly finished
it is the brain melting tedium of it
cant wait to find out half of these images dont work
g o o d g o d
and i finally noticed him
i was just getting the images
shelby
why in gods name would you ever have that miranda picture faintly in your profile picture
that was terrifying
oh my god shelby
*SHUT UP*
im workin on it
i have all the contestants
okie
we could bring back fumbledore and divorced ron as well
He
four more suggestions
garfield entering the ring
sure
turns out he was dead only for like a couple of days
we can bring back jesus
id rather not form the unholy alliance of tucker carlson and charlie kirk
the corona virus
there we go
armed with anger and brain damage
an anti-mask protester
for the sake of relevance
whats her name
BIGGY CHEEESEEE
it is
yeah
along with us of course
in the same district
we can have perhaps two of the paw patrol crew
yes
he will be added
despite my deep rooted hatred of Lip Bitin' Miranda
hitler stayin in
looking just a bit more traumatized though
skipper stayin in
with his facts and logic he will destroy all the sjw libs
shen bapiro stayin in
obama stayin in
because pigeon is entering no matter what
other than pigeon
who should we keep
first of all
oh good god
its a pain to do
should i set up another
sure
yeah obama lost
past me is so funny
wow
yeah
in the same district as hitler

everyone has tiddy tissue tho
it's just bros have male hormones and lack the female hormones to make tiddy to become female-like tiddy
actually technically everyone have tiddy
it's unlikely but not genetically impossible
person can have tiddy and pp
<:WollyMammoth:522573768963522560> = 0️⃣  🍆
bro if you have pp it must be very small
you dont have pp
itty bitty tiddy is still tiddy though bro

to be fair he is a millionaire so you might gain something out of being his fifth wife
he still has cancer
weegeth
he has cancer himself
for example cancer research
broseph he genuinely believes in the causes he donated for
exactly
he's donated quite a bit to charity though if that's worth anything
He believes modern day feminism "was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream society."
He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change
the Bloods and the Crips being gangs based in southern California who have historically African-American members
but he has also said, "The NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons."
in all fairness he has done charity work and written several best selling books including children's books
Limbaugh also dismisses the concept of consent

if they don’t make the products sound masculine the dudes may notice they’re being sold the exact same thing women are being sold
nah that’s really the reason behind it
but *manscaping*
see that wouldn’t be able to be marketed to females
can we just appreciate how the term manscaping is so much of a term that obviously is being marketed to men
I’m surrounded by buffoons
I hate that my first thought was, “why the fuck do balloon dogs need ‘manscaping’” instead of, “they’re just showing the razor doesn’t pop the balloon as a demonstration and all”

The very least someone can do is to compromise and by doing so protect the rest.
Along with every other holiday.
If they had their way the very thing they would be fighting for would have it's purpose destroyed.
Kyle, you must realize by now that the Christmasers are ravenous heathens who will not stop till every month is Christmas month.
It's still Thanksgiving Day.
Not till tomorrow Ben.
It has not been Christmas since last Christmas Shelby, and Kyle tomorrow it is absolutely okay to play Christmas music.
I by no means wish to raise myself above my own moral preferences.
However, I hold honesty in relation to proposing one's beliefs to be one of the most honorable traits to have.
I don't speak or adhere to a certain side, though it may cause me exile and much pain to do so.
it hasn't been christmas
or at least it's acceptable to begin getting in the mood
tomorrow is christmas

No Knee McGee can be spelled both forwards and backwards like the word racecar
you wanna know another wacky fact
well he can't for legal reasons technically be inside of the continent of america for longer than an hour
he always stunk of sulfur
and then next day he comes walkin in with brand new, shiny kneecaps
but god damn is it a thing to see him shave them off
did he have to pray to satan for it, sure
just like that
he grew them back,
he managed to shave through five different pairs of kneecaps
and it's not for nothin
they call my grandpa no knee mcgee
I know right
it's just for cleaning up afterwards
oh but you should ask
and using the rusty butter knife intimidate them by slowly shaving off your kneecaps right in front of them
take the stick, put it in your mouth and bite down
put the cloth off to the side
both of you sitting on chairs facing each other
you sit them down in front of you
I know how to earn respect from someone
now
calm, maybe afterwards
you have to earn it
there's one way I know how to instill respect
now as I was saying
ignore the pained screams of these tiny bezos' as I morph them into a stick, a piece of white cloth, and a rusty butter knife
then I'll probably have five or so
hmmm
I need you to fetch a stick, a piece of white cloth, and a rusty butter knife please
<@522523647919915014>
shelby
and there's one way I know how to instill respect
you need to learn respect
you can't keep this behavior up
now you don't get disrespectful with me young man
what don't you understand
small child
the shot was inside the bezos?
everyone's laughing until one of the bezos' that escaped pulls out a gun and adds to the chaos
**they scamper up your pant leg and crawl onto your shoulder on all fours awaiting further command**
~~**some are coming from the cracks in the walls**~~
saying stuff about amazon stock prices, blue horizons or whatever his space program is called, and screaming about now being the second richest person instead of the first

I caught that much I was simply attempting to end off the current topic in a humorous way
I am in no need of rest
but if you're showing me a bed I'll have to politely refuse
I think there's a few added words in there
there is no need to wrap someone in a blanket of denial out of an altruistic want to comfort them when they are perfectly fine with confronting the truth
however you would be entirely correct to say it is most likely bad
whether that is a practice in insanity or in vanity I do not know
messages that I've sent and forgotten about
and the thing that makes me laugh the most is myself
sometimes I just scroll through the chats history

im just trying to give thanksgiving a little room to breathe here
I legitimately like christmas a lot, who doesn't
he's definitely not my favorite holiday, especially when compared to the intoxicating and just easily spreadable christmas spirit
I'm not thanksgiving's friend
let's face it
I'm asking you to help him out a little
I'm not asking you to feel bad
it's not guilt tripping because I'm not specifically targeting you, it's just an emotional argument
it isn't his fault, he was made a certain way that makes him less noticeable but it still hurts
overshadowed by christmas
always being looked over
there isn't much of a thanksgiving spirit but you are hurting his feelings
it's almost a month
it is
there's a very widely known holiday in the way too
that's practically a month

'44 year old tire salesman from New Jersey Dwayne Johnson, Who has a slight resemblance to The Rock Johnson, was impeached today. The day after he was elected. Congresswoman Jenny McCarthy stated that the people were misled to believe they were voting for The Rock, when they were actually voting for The Sock (A nickname given to him after he left his fly open at a campaign event in Iowa). Congresswoman Jenny went on to say, "Once we get past this, we can move on to the serious business of government. My bill to require on screen TV experience to run for office will prevent this from ever happening again."'

I do like my pigmeat and horseflesh on the dinner table
I can understand
of course
which can make switches between gears in just 100 kilograms
and the seven slow thermal two hold transmission
aided by the 2020 shelby gt500's five hour energy powered engine
it can accelerate from 3 inches to 100 pounds in just one meter
making it the most powerful car orange circle has dared to make
forcefed with superpowers
due to its 7.5 ounce tin foil engine
the 2020 shelby gt500 has 700 pigpower

you know what
horsepower isn't-
my dude

which means the 2020 shelby gt500 can switch between gears in 100 milliseconds
aided by the 2020 shelby gt500's seven speed tremec dual clutch transmission
the 2020 shelby gt500 can also accelerate from 0 - 60 miles per hour in three seconds
making the 2020 shelby gt500 the most powerful car blue oval has dared to create
the car, the 2020 shelby gt500, is rumored to have around 750 horsepower at times
this is due to the fact that the 2020 shelby gt500 has a 5.2 liter aluminium engine forcefed with a supercharger
the 2020 shelby gt500 has around 700 horsepower

that's right
making a change between gears in just 100 milliseconds
aided by a seven speed tremec dual clutch transmission
being able to accelerate from 0 - 60 mph in just 3 seconds
the car, like its ancestors, does well in straight lines
making it the most powerful engine blue oval has made yet
its rumored it can reach levels of 750 horse power
with over 700 horsepower due to it's 5.2 liter aluminium engine forcefed with a supercharger it's a force to be reckoned with
the 2020 shelby gt500

I'm talking
no
hey shelby

I couldn't find a better replacement word for fault so I used mistake

You could save a life.
Share this video and help spread the word about sepsis.
* Have recently been to the hospital.
* Have had transplant surgery.
* Have a long-term illness.
* Have a weakened immune system.
You may also have a higher risk of you:
Very young children and the elderly are more prone to sepsis.
**S**hortness of breath.
A sense of "**I** feel the worst I've ever felt".
**S**leepy, difficult to wake up, or confused.
**P**ale or discolored skin.
**E**xtreme pain or discomfort.
**S**hivering, fever or feeling very cold.
You can use the word "SEPSIS" as your guide to know the symptoms.
This is sepsis.
That can start a chain reaction of organ failure that can be life-threatening.
But when that infection enters the blood stream, the immune system can start attacking the body's healthy organs.
When you get an infection your body's immune system fights it.
Sepsis starts with an infection: bacterial, viral, or some other organism.
That's more than breast cancer, prostate cancer and AIDS combined.
Sepsis kills nearly 300,000 Americans every year.

Perhaps a broken salmon may be more prone to the mental domination of Cheese.
It is hard for one to fake being a salmon, Fish. It would be more likely Cheese would corrupt a salmon rather than unnecessarily using his power to impersonate one.
But he is rotten.
Fish, this salmon may be of your race.
Indeed, as a fern I have far sight.
The animals are plentiful and powerful. Though it seems they are divided, and are fighting amongst themselves.
Fish, please tell me are all the children of Actaeon this divided?
Indeed, the salmon race is long and proud.
It is the nature of cheese to separate and make us worry about less pressing matters.
Rest easy Fish! Even if you were cod we take all allies we can.
Is this the evil and deceitful deeds of cheese at work?
And nothing unites beings like an existential threat.
Though we may live in uneasy peace, it is peace nonetheless.
The children of Actaeon are powerful, yet they would never side with you.
You could never live up to the legend of the ferns.
You may insult us, but you know only how to destroy and make more cheese.
And we will rid the Earth of your terrible color, once and for all!
We will defend all of Yavanna's creations to the very last fern.
You ruin the beautiful melody of nature with your heinous screeches.
The grass is meant to be green, it was Yavanna's intent, and you are challenging that holy intent.
You concern yourself only with things yellow, and spread cheese all where you go.
I thought we had cast you into the Timeless Void long ago.
You wretched foul being!
I know you are more than what you speak of.
I think you have a few motivations hidden, Cheese.
Mr. Cheese sir, may I inquire as to what your business here is?
Us ferns were similar in height to that of your skyscrapers, and our girth unmatched.
Earth was in harmony, and we were it's masters.
When the skies were bluer and the grass greener.
I remember the days long past.
Good.
There are few of my race, and we have greatly diminished with time.
Solely between acquaintances here, it is possible, but I implore you not to without consent of the fern.
If I were a less nobler being I would take offense, but I shall put it off as simply a mistake in words.
We are not that close.
Alas human!
It is of infinite importance that these secrets and knowledges doesn't escape into the grasp of humans.
We wish not for it's demise.
We ferns are tied to the Earth.
Though humans may be clever, their own hubris knows no bounds.
For I am supposed to protect humans from this knowledge.
Many great secrets humanity could only dream of knowing.
My leaves may be small, but my intellect is anything but that.
It is nice to see me finally treated with some dignity and respect.
Indeed, many have made that error in reasoning before.
Many would question why a fern is talking, especially a small one such as me, yet you are not.

you're missing out
"This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for."

unrelated
but it is an interesting observation that the people whose atoms originated in possibly the loneliest star were destined to never be alone
and I don't think upsilon meant to create people when dying
it really depends on how much spaceship ai and a nebula can love each other
zeus and athena maybe
to respond to it, the animals were like kinda friends but not really cause they didnt get enough time to know each other
and it does make sense though it does have quite a few stretches and leaps of logic
I did want to talk about upsilon does backwards after all
it's not that random
yeah I expected it to be more though
you made it sound like you decided to write a paragraph on a completely random topic and it made no sense
okay I expected that to be a lot worse
you've built it up a lot
okie
I'm interested
ramble if you wish
*aaaaaaaaa*
perhaps something on hiding in escapism
oh also the dude who was the only living crew member was placed in a dream fantasy place
the 2 out of 34 thing
and special individuals
and they are in fact unique
but it's made clear it isn't very practical a response on a wide scale
agatha and oliver are a special case where their existential question is answered by love
upsilon exploding backwards
zeus literally doing anything (including but not limited to murdering and dismembering people) to meet with someone else who is conscious and awoke the same as he did
like the animals panicking, but then accepting the sudden awareness and then death
but it's probably about the responses to awareness
the themes are more open to interpretation
the finer details and themes might pass by you the first time cause you are just trying to figure out what the heck this depressed turtle is saying
the main plot isn't too hard to pick up on
weeg
who ends up being the father of upsilon
and oliver has that slight connection to spaceship ai
who dreams of the animals
thus forming oliver
and ends up purposely going supernova backwards in time
and alone
the star that is conscious
they end up birthing upsilon
a nebula that suddenly became aware as well
and starts heading to athena
kills all but one crew member
he suddenly becomes aware
about a rogue ai in the future who calls himself zeus
which goes into the next story
it's hinted at by the animals in his dream that he programs or will program spaceship ai, if you didn't catch it
2 of 34 humans who can actually form a nearly perfect relationship
both of their atoms were mainly formed in the backwards death of Upsilon

‘Malfoy Munchers’

‘Malfoy Munchers’
‘Malfoy Munchers’
weeg
but also read hpmor ben
yeah
i love it
the bitter sweetness cause it ended well but you wont get to do it over again
personally i live for the feeling i get after a series i've been reading for a long time ends
dont worry about it
if you can compare it like that it means you're doing something right
its going to be even a long time before you get through the main stuff despite being on the sixth book
if you dont count the movies theres all 100+ chapters of hpmor
plus you know its not like its the only main story to read through
yet neither is bad
its the difference between being a student and an elder
but such it is when you grow into the role of a true potterhead
and it will continue to be as you go throw more media
and it will be different
its fine
its a cycle you see
and well versed
and then you can pass it on once you are properly read
it **n e v e r e n d s**
or the countless fan websites to browse through
or hpmor
whether it be rewatching the movies over and over
unless you deliberately close it out
but its never over
you can do less relating to it
you can never be done with harry potter
i havent in forever
or even just watch the movies again
i really need to reread
ooooh
where are you at in the sixth book
interesting

also
i love them
which i thoroughly agree with
The Good Ship
romione is just referred to as
HMS Flaming Toad
neville and ginny
which is very very fitting
S.S. The Government Stole My Toad
also can i comment on the apparent nautical name for neville and luna
i love it
**my god**
my god
yeah its great
t h i c c h e r b t e a c h e r
you know ignore me about what i was about to say about the harry and tonks ship, (honks)


***thicc herb teacher***
not
i think you mean sprout ben
***iM dyIng***
***Oh MY GOD***
***WOW***
their nautical name is pretty nice
and only one thing to harmony
i will grant one thing
i would do that but because i dont want people to ruin such an amazing character
not as bad as harry and snape though
thats real bad
thats bad
ah god yeah
waht
and the dramione shippers
i still hate it though
and i doubt it affects my opinion at all
but that was a long time ago
i have read the beginning chapters of a really well written and semi-believable dramione fanfic
also ill admit
indeed
because im smart
and a style
its a strategy
this is why i have more messages
no
or sending videos that explain it more elegantly than i
thats why i havent been saying more in my rants
sorry
i cant spoil things
like completely ignorant of the entire dynamic of the trio that propels the series kinda bad
weeg
ignorant kinda bad
idiotic kinda bad
bad
like really
harmony is bad
but
and most people grow out of it
i know the mistake that is being made
it means less
and because of that
which is mostly 12 year old girls who like that kinda thing
dramione has that bad boy appeal to the people who that actually appeals to
the thing is
but
weeg
yeah but its more trivial
~~so this is what tribalistic human behavior is like~~
***yessss***
***yes***
no we need people like you
someone with sense is alive
YES
HAHA
YES
because they only watched the movies
there are more harmony shippers than dramione
because i can assure you
in every sense
its terrible
leave ron and basically forget about him
so what they do is switch around that harry and hermione connection
and they make assumptions
because of course the movies miss the fine details of the books
OoOOh HArRy and HerMIone aRe CutE toGetgjErefefdrfg
go
is they watch the movies
but what the harmony shippers do
in a believable way
it makes the trio work
is cause perfect harmony among the friends
and what this does
and ron and hermione have their thing
ron and harry are the classic good friend duo
harry and hermione are like brother and sister, and that upholds their link
the trio
the perfect dynamic they had
is DESTROYiNG
what harmony is
and redeem him
but she can save him
hes a really messed up guy
ooooh
dramione is just a bunch of kids who bask in the idea of
the dynamic here
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
no NO
i hate them
or a nobel prize winner
or really kind
i dont care if they are a genius
i believe in my deepest of hearts anyone who ships harry and hermione are people i should never talk to
but even more so
i also despise the harmony ship
ahem
~~i hope they burn~~
so how dare they even attempt to intrude upon such things
and their banter
i love her and rons back and forth
despite what i say
she doesnt
and i hate them with a passion
and there are really well written fanfics
like i despise dramione
mmmm
but if its well written
those silly fanfic writers
if its really bad i can ignore it as
*how dare you tarnish my beautiful characters*
so my mind goes to
well i care about these characters
but to be fair im not exactly one to vigorously support relationships in books
i hate a lot of the ships
weeg
a mere mortal
and you
for i am a god
i see all
you cant hide things from me

well humanity should level out at about 12 billion people with the current fertility rates declining in industrializing countries
and that wont help scarce resources
we are already destined to 9 billion by 2050

it's really interesting how you've managed to be more active than me in the past 30 days

yeah
did you have a lead?
it's my destiny
I take this as a sign
even with my inactivity on the server
yeah
I have 50k messages
woag
s u r e
congrats on making the public even more intrigued
wow
yeah that's true, murdering a 13 year old girl doesn't sound at all like something that would catch on in the news
other than you
that still sounds like someone's dying
erm
even if it is an "accident"
the nature of your death is open to question usually
again it's very open
even if there wasn't a pact you're probably taking a few people with you
you can just like not die
I think it's kinda left up to interpretation
I have no clue
oh well that's lovely
oooooof
upload your mind to a machine

he's beautiful
*wow*

its just a bit funny
no its true i concede the point
i always find someone bragging about video game prowess slightly amusing
i find the opposite
really
with a controller you twiddle sticks
with a mouse you move it
its absurd
no it isnt
weeg
to me at least its just so unintuitive
how to you play any game in first person with a controller
i know
the server with just a few more people is an interesting thought
weeg
a bruise is simply a mark that appears when demons are leaving your worldly body

i do get my high off of minecraft though
you're just thinking too much
i was just playing at the moment

a couple dead ends
hastily made barriers of cobblestone
i ran
just the pure panic and *oh god oh god oh god*
it was the most fun i had in minecraft in a few days
yeah
i panicked pretty hard
a bunch came after me
and *oh god*
instinct i guess
dunno why
and i accidentally clicked
it just rounded a corner in the nether fortress
that was the most oh god moment i've had in minecraft
but seriously
its fine
the blood is on your hands
i wouldnt be this violent if it wasnt for things like that
this is what you do when you say nonsense like this
to prove a point im going to murder one right now
no it doesnt
a horde was after me
my life was kinda on the line there
its not that bad to punch baby pig
its very bad to punch baby pigman
yeah i dont think you understand
i was directing that towards shelby l before you said die you pig but it probably still applies
both of you
whats wrong with you
I RAN
THIS IS GENUINELY BAD
OH MY JESUS
OH DEAR GOD
I MADE A GRAVE ERROR
OH MY GOD IM SCREWED
OH GOD I ACCIDENTALY PUNCHED A BABY PIGDUDE

wait a moment

you are uncultured in the way of internet memes
did you know the tiananmen square massacre didnt happen?
welp i guess sam is dead
there is some questionable logic in this here
I do hope something like that doesn't suffer the same problems that anonymity grants in the usual internet chatting hellscape, but that's very unlikely.
To be honest telepathy may be entirely possible within a century with neural implants that connect up to an internet of sorts.
Well, I hardly think that takes into account how grammar is an essential part of any language and that's a very impractical idea unless you are suggestion telepathy.

dwarf fortress was a major inspiration for minecraft fun fact
sounds pretty stupid
never heard of it
the pun is always intended
graphics innovation
that stuff is the height of like
you know dwarf fortress the game
dwarf fortress
eyyyyyyyyy
im just exploring for now
im going to do that eventually
i've been playing on this server for like ten, fifteen minutes and im already completely lost in a massive sprawling mine cavern created by other people
goodnoot
waht
it sounding wrong and silly is why its funny
nut
i only live for the multiplayer minecraft survival experience
yeah i dunno
haha im doing a minecraft
imagine someone asking a baby for their debt to be returned
i thought insanity was a legal term but ok
i dont think thats a mental illness
what kind of sicko would threaten an infant
fair enough
ha neeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
i dunnno
i have the need to play minecraft now
im beginning to think you dont know what pda means
waht
more kodkod

weeg
baby kodkod

the forest is known for having strangely small animals
a massive forest pocket
found in south america i believe
weeg
blep


like jacobs
weeg
allahu akbar
*brilliant*
is anyone's house free?
and as a very sure backup we can bring over board games
play board games
ya know
we could also
alrighty,
are we going through on a minecraft party, cause i dont know how that would work
yup
well we can still plan if you guys want to
anyways so are we doing something tomorrow
water
haha

yeah that works
well shouldnt the time instead be fitted to the event rather than the event be fitted to the time?
what are we doing
im so confused as to what is happening
fair enough
you are a very confusing person
but no
that wasnt what i expected you to say
jacob
very confusing
she is like made of paper
its actually 20
im allergic to gamers
guten tagen
byeee
yeah fair enough
me
to
dead
are
you
and play vidja gamjas
anyways i think im going to do what i was going to do an hour and a half ago
mmhhmmmmm
they were so popular they got to meet obama
but like how
you dont have to watch it
dont worry too much about it im just teasing you
three years late shelby
i simply cant believe you
the old mythbusters has been over for years now
i *think* jacob has
i've talked about it before
im sure someone has
~~dont apologize im overexaggerating my dismay~~
your taste in media is so disappointing
you fill me with only sadness
but i watched nearly every single mythbuster episode to ever exist
i dont watch tv
**t h a t s n o t a n e x c u s e**
s o ?
like what's going on inside your head
i dont understand how you function
you watch all the wrong shows
its the mythbusters for god's sake
you fill me with only sadness
YOU CANT BE SERIOUs
SHELBY
SHELBY
oNLY TWICE
i cant find a clip of it on youtube
the death giggles
its from the new mythbuster team
you disappoint me
you've never had the death giggles?
im getting the death giggles just thinking about it
**order melts into a thing of the past**
around the same time cause tylers plot similarly
yeah cause the plots would hide themselves, but once the end phase kicks in
so he could see through them
and possible things a fellow tyler would do to tyler proof his own plots
but also making sure that he isnt being plotted against
not only making his own plots tyler proof
and they also usually know the thought process of a tyler, so they'd have to compensate for that
and probably how to even use the purge to their advantage
so what each tyler would be doing is trying to ensure to be kept in the new administration
a certain amount of supporters are usually purged to make way for the new administration
once a coup goes through
cause i know how coups work
NO NO NO
weeg
*how does one go about replacing him with myself with minimal casualties*
that would be one of my first thoughts
cause like they'd try to take my place if i was to show i have authority over all the clones
*the complex plots of the tyler council*
like the clones would plot against each other and me
actually i'd have to find a way to make the clones not be able to harm me or each other cause thats something i would do
im getting clones of myself as soon as i possibly can
weeg
knowing exactly what the other wants for the joke
but with so many of me
occasionally i cause chaos just to have fun
cause like
im just imagining the chaos
the council of tylers
oh yeah
imagine the chaos with just two of me
you just made the idea really appealing
o h h e l l y e a h
i need a clone of myself
only the creator can properly mold their creation
it wouldnt as long as the milk was properly stirred by gran's own hands
you know what me
it'll be my downfall
im not sayin anything
nah nah nah
many
so
i could say so many things
waht

daddy has been said 60 times
w h y
god
**YES**
w o w
of course i've already said that
**holy milk**
Did you know Donald J. Trump is actually the second black president?
O H YEAH
o H

but no one quite makes me laugh the way i do when i look on stuff from past me
maybe its a bit narcissistic
OH
'did you ever look at kale and say, "I wish I was in a boat in the middle of a lake staring up at the bright full moon all alone with my thoughts, feelings, and 12 buckets of kale and one tomato I brought along"' - me
give me something
give me a strange word
o h
why youtube gods
im sad now
belly rubs
rolling over
like it was an animated baby shark but acting like a household animal
remember?
what the hecc
and now the channel has been removed?
i think
that was the weird vietnamese video with the shark
that
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gu15nM6QjCE
weeg
but without context it made me laugh
i think it was cards against humanity now that i look more into it
"it was self loathing or estrogen"
why did i say
screw video games
im just looking at things without context now
**z o O t o P i A**
i have tourettes
and in fact i laughed pretty hard at it when it was first sent
it made me laugh to
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522534502359236609/564343180011765760/unknown.png
yeah
also i just searched through all the times, "im so confused" has been said and for some reason it made me laugh
yeah
well
oh
they're just crackers
they are freaking crackers what are you talking about
w     h     a     t
o k a y ?
im so confused
"**you freaking pastry**"
"i just like that some people legitimately offensive"
im so confused
w h a t
its absolutely hilarious
i have to be honest i love that "*cracker*" is like the semi-slur against white people

personally as a black myself, i am offended
what a racist
so a  **c o l o r e d**  person cant be calming?
what's wrong with someone's voice being calming
subtle racism huh?
course
course you'd think a  **c o l o r e d**  is terrifying without reason
i think you're a racist

sometimes you cause me physical pain
obsession

yeah that's a bad sign
I wouldn't do that for even my favorite shows

cause frock coats are quite nice looking if done right
but dont ignore the history
i do agree, frock is a dress
yeah it makes more sense in the modern context, which is the reason i said not necessarily rather than straight up no
i *am* a genius after all
or be made the idiot
do your research
google further my dear
as shown in the picture
it could also refer to a frock coat
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frock
also how could you sam
always check the wikipedia page
wikipedia my dear
not necessarily a type of dress
isnt that a type of clothing item
f r o c k
frock
what's wrong with me
oh god oh frick I missed 4:20
lovely
yup
there aren't many tests and they aren't very hard
in my experience we hit some tubes together, learned a little basic guitar and music like notes, and then we listened to music and the evolution of it for like and entire quarter
so you'll probably be fine
not much happened in last year music despite my own lack of interest in music

okie
if that makes sense
but internally it's a mental tornado
I mean it is externally speaking
but no its not that simple
so I don't say those things
you see the really jerk thing to say is, "is it that bold" but I'm nice
that's a comedic exaggeration but still
the purest form
it's pure terror
you can't talk
jacob you haven't been in my position
like I wish it was that simple
weeg
bah
weeg
are you just going to keep editing your message to perfect it while jabob takes another 50 minutes to answer
I never said I didn't want to
I even said it'd be nice
yeah

I don't know
oh jesus

I forgot the entire month of May existed
oh my god
help people are setting off boom booms
yeah she's laying on me
okie
how am I suppose to be able to toss and turn and get tangled in wires
Charlotte is like sitting right on top of me and its immobilizing
that's a deeply personal problem
I'm trying to get it out of my head
I don't even know
*does it?*
~~add it to the family tree~~
weeg
I can see that
so like a laidback mom or a grandmother
that's true
weeg
also jacob has anyone told you sometimes you come across as a mother or grandmother?
it's terrible
that's the worst part
you're being numbed
even this abridged version nearly gave me terminal cancer
I dunno
i
yeah
w. e. e. g.
w e e g
Filch is the cat and Mr. Norris is the person
***yeah***
so
I just watched it end
*yeah*
that would be nice but to be fair my awkwardness and lack of confidence knows no bounds
well
the plot twists are something else
quoting
IS DAT TOOT OF CRAKTER
C
interesting
make it stop freezing
you arent sorry enough
dont even act like it
ron isnt in your character hall of fame
you arent enough
no you arent
but i wish my hermione wasnt reskinned
as few characters as possible
yeah
well
nah
ron isnt in it
weeg
im just listening to it
so
i could still tell what was happening
you arent even that far in
SHELBY
there's no ron
s e n s e
yeah that makes
some of the names are priceless
***YEAH***
LUPIN WAS CALLED LUMPKIN
oH MY GOD
i legitimately feel my brain reeling in confusion

which made me physically recoil
they say later they only watched the movies

probably
s OH
that
are you "goffick"
you're looking awfully emo there shelby

yeah
SO YOU CANT COMPLAIN
AND YOUR NOT THAT FAR IN
YOU HAVEN READ ALL OF THE BOOKS
SHELBY
y OU CANT COMPLAIN
you cant complain
okay
shelby how far in are you
i h a t e i t
it
i hate emo culture so much
***FEEL PART OF MY PAIN***
*feel part of my pain*
you havent even read all of it
it is
yeah
i lost it
*crookshanks*
but when enoby casts a spell called
like that part i can imagine someone writing that was unjokey
god
yeah it is really bad
you're kind of projecting there
they would be fine
nah its a troll
what the heck are you talking about
thats much worse
not cause they legitimately thought it was good
and released it
they did it
and funny
cause it was someone found it so pathetic
FUNNIER
or terrifying
not sad
its funnier that way
yeah
but it is much better if someone intentionally did that
i just answered my own question
it isnt
is it?
no questions
now that i've listened to more of it read im for sure it was a troll who wrote it
ITS LEGITIMATELY VOMIT INDUCING
THEIR LOOKS ARE DESCRIBED SO MUCH
TRY ME
IM DOING THE SAME
AND I LIKE IT
YOU'RE INSANE
I COULDNT BRING MYSELF TO WATCH THE NEXT PART

and unnatural is self explanatory
which is about 70-80
or somewhere around there
premature death is before the average age of death I believe
no?
it's not my fault I was forced to this extreme
I don't care if it doesn't fit the label I'm doing it
then it's an agreement
fine
yeah
guten tag
if anyone here dies unnaturally or prematurely I'm counting it as suicide in the suicide pact
I have a revision to my side of it
you make me have to do this
okay
no

***prepare for a crash landing in the rice fields***
weeg essentially
* fortunate son intensifies *
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7qkQewyubs
its a turtle with a plant on it's back
weeg
and the machine guns start firing at anything that moves
and it slowly gets louder till you can see one of us in a helicopter coming straight at the village
you can hear fortunate son playing and the beat of helicopter blades
in the distance...
that's when faintly
some nice food they are offering us
they are lovely accommodating people
like we are talking to some of the natives
yeah
"nah thats just sam"
"**THERE'S GUNSHOTS COMING FROM THE TREES, THEY'RE IN THE TREES**"
like all on their own
someone is wiping out an innocent village
if its vietnam
yeah
going on our own little ~~warcrimes~~ adventures
or splitting up
that's what happening
we are getting lost in the jungle then picked off with traps and mines
but
perhaps
i have a much more pessimistic view
if anything happens to offsets the balance everyone dies
we are getting the basic things done
wishful thinking
with friendly fire turned on
a squad patrolling vietnam
any situation where we are meant to behave as a unit
weeg
maybe a tank crew
really the friend group in any scenario close to that is funny
weeg
i want this
yeah
or like tries to go into sub-orbital flight
stalls us out
or someone keeps flying up
yeah
our wings are shearing off and we are blacking out due to the g-forces
like straight down at mach 3
if we were in a plane someone would just make us dive
we would be a greater danger to ourselves than the enemy
yeah
and i mean absolutely everything
everything breaks down
i dont think either of us can truly imagine the level of chaos that would happen if we were to be engaged by an enemy and we actually got a slight system going
weeg
in everyone's eyes
i was thinking it would be used against each other
yeah
that isnt going to be used for fires
god forbid if there's fire extinguisher on board
yeah
like three people would die before we move
yeah
our own blastwave would hit us and bring us down
someone would drop the bombs at an unsafe height
yeah
one person will like try to take off or dive without any of us knowing
and i say we
if its a submarine we dive before we close the hatch and we all drown
if its a plane we crash on attempted take off
i say five minutes
it would take a few tries before we reach 30 minutes
nah
the pure chaos before everything goes to hell and we all die is worth all of the pain
weeg
or like as a bomber crew
weeg
i'd totally pay to have the whole friend group placed in a ww2 era u-boat without any training and try to actually sink something and not die
***EGG NUT***

the alignment chart does not account for subtleties

I know
to find their accounting club
I scrolled only a little down
and when I was on that page
and he graduated from the University of Hawaii–West Oahu
named Gary Hooser
another hawaii politician or previously
I clicked on someone related
and that was in hawaii
and then I randomly clicked on one of the first transgender woman to win a statewide election
and I clicked on a link about someone in Hawaii and was an activist and all that
so I googled it
so I wanted to know how many queer asian americans there are
queer asian american high school teen girls in a baseball club
so I thought it was a bit funny that the game focused on such a specific minority of people that actually probably exist
they are legitimately connected
wait
and looking at the fact they have an ***accounting club***
of the University of Hawaii–West Oahu
I'm somehow at the Wikipedia
and now
I did another quick Google on butterfly soup

indeed
minecraft in searches has surpassed fortnite
the heresy has been contained for now in indiana
weeg
according to google trends utah is really interested in minecraft
that makes sense
yeah
yes
wait
no
wa9t?
google trends confirms it

indeed it is
good
i thought you were a heretic
oh thats relieving
thats good
EYYYYOOOO
both terms can be used interchangeably
a druffocation
kind of both
that makes sense
ice is such a confusing thing
like does the ice stay frozen
is it drowning or suffocating if its ice?
im consuming ice as we speak
exactly
if you eat it you're all good
cause if you drink it thats just water
well do you drink the ice or eat it?
dont you ever just feel so alive after eating like three pounds of just ice?
yes it does
its frozen
nah nah nah
i have variety in my diet now
see
and make into a nice popsicle
ill take that onion vomit
you know what
keeps my bones weak and all
its healthy
nah
its a problem
weeg
***I THEN I EAT THAT VOMIT***
***I EAT THEM TILL I VOMIT***
***I WOULD DIE FOR THEM***
***I LIVE FOR DEEP FRIED ONIONS SHELBY***
i prefer my onions deep fried
they are very similar to apples
***just freaking takes a bite out of an onion***
indeed
and its taken this form
yes
the revitalization of minecraft is a beautiful thing
indeed
this is the height of entertainment

ahem sorry
***a Jism***
***or as I would say***
***are you saying there was a schism***
I'm in though
as an outspoken atheist I don't know how I feel about running a corrupt organized religion that scams people
people readily hand over their thanccc coin
it's really quite profitable
people can pay to relieve their sins
much akin to the ~~real~~ christian one
the jim church is incredibly corrupt
fair point
call for a jimhad against all heretics
I wish to install Jimriah Law
that would be interesting
all that jazz
start holding times to pray
we really need to centralize
that's true
it must feel strange
mmmmmhmmmm
yeah no why are you in ko kaisership
who are you
change your username and your an entirely different person
it's strange
I'm reading your text as though you were a different person
I think I've mentioned him before
I always love randomly flailing limbs and too many eyes and mouths
they are
whomever
them
personally I'd worship him
have some azathoth
but I dunno
I'm trying to find some that are as nice as the nebulous nightmares themselves
cause some people are sadistic like that I guess
the thing about lovecraftian horror is that it's *meant* to instead leave a deeply unsettling feeling that sticks with you a long time
or specifically not
cause that may suit you
shall I introduce you to the idea of lovecraftian horror
I like it
I'm quite fond of that picture
I wish
you are right
ignore the fact I can barely tie my own shoes
quite the philosopher I am
I ponder life's secrets
mmmmmm
I was about to say that was an awfully hipsterish thing to say
is there a difference?
those are clearly normal nonsentient gas clouds, and not at all massive alien unknown lovecraftian horrors beyond our imagination
I don't know what your talking about
pfffff
big space gas bowl
cauldron nebula

wait a momento
indeed
shiny


yer a nebula harry
wizard's nebula


towering monoliths of gas

oh and actual pretty stuff
egg

that would be brilliant
not what I expected to find on the space engine discord

fair enough
unless I just secrete so much face grease and swet it doesn't matter
well that's assuming my pillow hasn't been washed
indeed
Charlotte stole me pillow
I'll try
I'll be right back I gotta make a joint outta my own skin

i give up
there's always something

are you saying i need to get blackmail level info on you?
mmmmmhpmh
cause if you really didnt want that you would just stay quiet about it
frankly if you ever say something like, "ill stop now before i say something i regret" it kinda feels like you want us to press you for more information
bold of you to assume
well you've made me curious now
have no fear i wont hold anything against you
*are you taking a rat wedding seriously*
as she said
im well aware it twas but a joke
its mostly jokes
i dont really think this is a serious discussion
do we?
yup
why not make them one in the same
i refuse to ever change my mind in the future
ah yes im going to spend 18 years of my life dealing with a little piece of crap just to raise it into a slowly decaying world
you're insane
no it isnt
why
that
yeah i dont see how the whole parenting process would be worth it just cause you named him egg
"Lilpigboy"

"frick"

i see

there ya go
i like big buildings
well i dont think absolutely everything should be smol
very smol
0/10
like an inch tall
i need a very tiny bear around constantly
i think worms are underrepresented on the food pyramid thingy
my favorite food is salmon
mine is exactly five and a third croutons
like that going up your nose
like imagine snorting a whole worm
o u c h i e
"slurping worms"
when talking about consuming worms its always referred to as
also its not eating worms
***yes***
weeg
at least he's going to eat
its better than anything longer than that
oh with my diet im going to die at 30
so?
nah i think ill eat like 15 muffins
i want cheerios now
try a single cheerio
there you go
***eat people***
thats even ignoring id say the best path to being healthy and losing weight is diet
dont worry its only a little intrusive
get a room with a bunch of screens with everyones vitals
woag
we should have a visit to the hospital so you could get food tubes connected
you both are insane
https://www.change.org/p/rename-fire-ants-to-spicy-boys
Fire Ants should be renamed to "Spicy Ants"
ants in general are strong in comparison to their size and weight
what about army ants
also im mostly talking about politics because i've been waiting three hours for a game to download and i dont have anything to talk about
420
interesting
either way
in my opinion the only notable difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is that social democrats ultimately dont believe in converting over to complete socialism, and instead in reforming current capitalism
basically your beliefs are most closely to that of bernie sanders
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy
noun
a socialist system of government achieved by democratic means.
"there was a growth of social democracy through an extension of the rights of citizens"
alrighty
anyways shelby you said that you didnt know what any of it meant
right
instead of handing it to the state
which is why i simply believe in actually giving the workers the means of production
a state run economy is too ripe for corruption and mishandling
which collapsed mostly due to economic issues
tell that to the dead body of the ussr
i disagree with communism especially if its state run
waht?
i'd say im more of a democratic socialist
i think the test mistakes a dislike for authority to always be libertarian
personally i disagree with libertarianism so thats a bit inaccurate
but its for the protection of the rights of people
the opposite is anarchy
no the opposite
and the society axis im very progressive
i would say liberal
on the government axis i usually go between libertarian and liberal
on the diplomatic i was internationalist
on my economic axis i was socialist
i got libertarian socialist
thats interesting
i dunno
jeez
im at 4:02
your time is at 4:01
i dont know what you're talking about
weeg
go figure if you put strongly disagree for everything it lists you as a centrist
of course
what did that make
https://8values.github.io/index.html
alrighty
if you wish
i would've sent you a shorter test some time ago but now i feel like you might as well finish it now
weeg
i personally use my own logic and background knowledge for some cause im not going to become super prepared to have a bunch of studies back up every single answer i have
at least on the test
there isnt right or wrong
the point is to get what YOUR values are
thats not the point shelby
"Our nation's values should be spread as much as possible."
"My religious values should be spread as much as possible."
ultimately i said it was justified
either way that should make you think a few moments if you get stuck up on violence
at what point is a government considered authoritarian
is it justified to use violence against an authoritarian government that is using violence against you?
thats a cool idea experiment
that one should get you thinking
"Even when protesting an authoritarian government, violence is not acceptable."
which is like 25 in
im just doing them in order from where i've started
"Governments should be accountable to the international community."
"Research should be conducted on an international scale."
thats straight forward
"My nation is great"
"International aid is a waste of money"
makes sense
i mean
wow
most are pretty straight forward
a h
and i only get about three
but if i feel a maybe i tend to go neutral
perhaps its because my political beliefs are more fleshed out than yours
do some of these require a maybe?
but like not
but more to one side
an inbetween option that isnt neutral
hows the test coming along
congrats
hm?
waht
noice
*the culling shall come*
*yes*
weeg
on reddit
i heard of a person who married this year on that date while they were still in college so that one of their anniversaries would land on that date
maybe
body mass index
god dang it thats a good idea
January people are average
so as it goes on it gets exponentially longer
can we just have like life length depend on what month you're born in
weeg
july people will live forever
thats just how it be
death arrives quickly

i was about to send
GOD DANG IT BEN YOU BEAT ME TO IT
nice age to die
35
ah
you were born in 1860?
what did you put
normal its 2079 as i said before
2042 is me on sadistic
im dying december 10th 2042
thats true
weeg
personally i like optimistic cause i feel it slightly takes into account the rapid advance of medical technology
weeg
thats on normal mode at least
roughly
yeah im dyin december 10th, 2079
n o s h e l b y
20 what
thats cause your female
i have 60 years left boys
i just know my bmi is probably below 25
i guessed
i dont know my weight either
measure yeeself
yeah same
have fun confronting your own mortality
http://www.deathclock.com/
can i recommend to you death clock
yayyyy
but thats good you want to
the only reason i do is cause im a nerd with no life
i dont expect a 13 year old to have an actual understanding of anything political
shelby you dont really have to care
its fine
you dont have to finish it
hows the quiz coming along
a a a a a a aaaaa a aa a a aa a a a
a a a a a a a a a a a a a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a

please no
one
single
but every
if you are genuinely unsure go ahead
i'd rather you actually take a stance
if you dont have a head headaches arent a problem
ill be back
ew that hurts
so i walk around a lot in the living room and basement sometimes
to think i generally pace
ill come back and check on your progress on the quiz
anyways im going to the bathroom for some time
Epic Gamer
i havent ever played a treasure wars game
F
i am a dirty socialist after all
you dont have entirely trust my opinion
at least thats how i see it
now the question is whether private, rich interests are better than the publics
they fund things to advance their own interests
people dont fund things for no reasons
thats generally what funding causes
the consequence is as such the publics interests are more represented
but publicly funded research is research that gets its funds from the general public
you are still a kid after all
i shouldnt expect you to know this
im genuinely curious
what dont yee understand
i thought these questions were simple ones of values
cause im really confused as to what you dont know
what question was the last one you googled
for each question
how long are you taking
jesus pepperoni
byee
think
well
what is it your answering
have fun
https://8values.github.io/
you may have to take an online test in a momento shelby
this god business and now politics is getting me thinking
oh god oh frick oh god
landslide victory
heck yeah
wait till we get a president who is actually from this generation and he tries to connect to his voters by calling himself an Epic Gamer
also i have no clue where i got that statistic so dont quote me on that
we need to spread the gamer word
did you know general men and women play games at around the same rate yet men are twice as likely to call themselves gamers?
b e r i g h t b a c k m y f e l l o w g a m e r s
yeah if you please please please make the stoat slightly smart at least
a stoat would straight up end the world
do you know keanu reeves beliefs and what he would do?
do you have any idea what your doing?
you are completely insane
and why
whomst
i fully accept your offer to pass your godhood onto me
to be fair most 13 year olds would
at least you arent one of those monsters who believe death is natural
when would you institute it
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
do you believe death should exist first of all?
oh jesus
utilitarian is more consequentialist
for example a deontological perspective is based on whether the actions your performing is bad in of itself or not
ehhhh thats generally a goal that most ethics go to
do you subscribe to a utilitarian perspective?
i am you just have to google
do you have any major deontological moral injunctions?
like whats some major parts of your moral framework
jabob i dont even know your moral framework
does nation states give you ptsd
shelby every single thing you would do millions would criticize as messing with the natural order
even something you would think would be universally accepted
every single decision you make will make someone mad
shelby
especially big ones
she would be really nervous making decisions
however if she wasnt completely omnipotent
and i doubt she would use the god like status to enrich herself
if she could see ahead the exact things she needed to do of course she would do them
you see it really depends on how omnipotent she would be
alright
once humanity is an intergalactic space faring civilization you can make a pokemon world alright?
*shelby this isnt what is important*
really it depends on how omnipotent she is
she has good morals and intentions, although her moral framework isn't rigorous and as such she wouldn't be the best possible candidate
happy pets
fine
just wait a decade while ya know we guarantee the continued longevity of life on earth
but thats not the most pressing issue
sure?
leading scientists, philosophers, and world leaders
i would have a council of smart peepos
of course
i feel the need to create my idealistic tech-oriented-transhumanist-ecofriendly-socialist paradise
but i would really rather have it
i mean i dont need it
me
yes please gimme
all that jazz
stop disease and war
grant humanity immortality
just like lend a hand every once in a while
that would be my job
im not asking you to become God Empress of Humanity or anything
like you dont have to do much
please give us faster than light space ships too
*just try and help*
*shelby global warming is going to end all of us*
make animals speak
like
you'd just
or try
like i'd bring a new age of prosperity onto humanity
oh jesus you would be useless
yeah thats true
and that is a warning signal in of itself
because i would willingly become god
but its probably better than someone like me
oh yeah
just a lil bit scary
i dont know how i feel about you becoming an omnipotent god
well for you not everyone else
that would be nice
tell me if hell is real
i was about to say you are either just straight up dying or ascending to a higher realm of existence
yeah
what im hearing is that your time for this earth is limited
woel
woo fun
that moment when the bees get 345 gold from killing some hoomans
personally i love mincecraft
mincecraft
my favorite game
yuperooo

goodnoot
oh?
nope different time zone
it could be wacky
at least me phone says so
for me it is ten
indeed
eyyyyy I'm in a different time zone
ohno
they like tip the bowl over and flow out
oh mein gott
all I can hear are the squeals
squeals
oh my godd
is that not your first thought
weeg
imagine opening the box and pouring them out

congrats
that's fine
same affect
can't you just have like fifty different tshirts with that on it
and frankly I'd have to explain to people why I'm in a relationship with someone who has ninety nine tattoos all of which read like the random ramblings of a mad man
they just aren't very pleasing to the eye
on anyone
I just in general don't like tattoos
yeah but you'd have to live with that constantly
but bad in practice
I mean great in theory
not a permanent tattoo of that stuff
you know can you maybe get like
but yeah same
how manly of you
very odd ex-convict
just a very odd
weeg
your gonna end up looking like an ex-convict
not magically, rectally
but the process is so confusing and frankly strenuous it must be a possibility he has to entertain
he entertains the thought that he might have passed out in the middle, and frankly most people would notice if they blacked out
oh god I just realized something
weeg
and then he unloads that
but we both sit down
I'm a bit confused as to why he's excited
like I can imagine a friend I've known for a long time coming to my house one day
and its all rather confusing
the melon is gone
apricots fall out
just
and then
I was laughing a little at the beginning because it so casually mentions how he shoves apricots *right up there*

this made me laugh a little too much
going along the theme of slightly disturbing
indeed
thousands others would
I'd watch that
so am I...
so am I
like I sent that with the intent to cause a reaction
can we pay more attention to spongebob feeding mr krabs chum please?
I don't deny I said what ever wrong
also why the screenshot
don't ever make something in ms paint
nope
gimp is free
well isn't that peachy

Albert Einstein

he's a terrible person
and that most mass shooting are
he's been a massive proponent in the conspiracy theory that it's been a cover up
what do you expect
yeah
like he couldn't be an even more terrible human being
what is surprising was that he sent the child pornography to sandy hook survivors
not all too surprising
go figure
*suree*
*lovely*
that means your amygdala is working properly
good
yeah
my line of, "your the one coming up with the tv show as we go along" wasn't an open invitation

try not to restart an argument
by now your just complaining and not presenting any arguments I have countered
as such its hard to avoid
it's the main server we use
everyone uses this
plus
because it doesn't hurt someone if it isn't sent
if Sam doesn't feel comfortable with the semi-graphicy and suggestive images you are sending then they aren't going to be on here
gus do I need to explain

you don't have to delete the previous ones
I'm not on discord constantly so I need <@&528425146483212292> to help me here in moderation

I shall leave wegg to die I suppose
the U spellings in England occured due to a dictionary that was printed there and not the US deciding deliberately for Us in stuff like laboUr
and gradual shifts

to be honest by now i was hoping someone would've debunked that argument
okie bye
cracker
racism has always been the systematic oppression of a race of peoples, and since (at least im assuming we are speaking about america) mexicans have never held the institutional power to persecute germans on a wide scale. as such a statement like that (assuming you are saying that i would be racist if i said that) would be empty, it wouldnt be racist it would be prejudiced.
rAcIsT
i cant be racist
your still a racist
allahu akbar
how would you know
checkmate
you cant be racist if you arent white
i cant be racist
*racist*

why is chess segregated
yeah
Three Toes for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Toe Lord on his toe throne
In the Land of Big Toes where the Shadows lie.
One Toe to rule them all, One Toe to find them,
One Toe to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,
In the Land of Big Toes where the Shadows lie.
*yeehaw partner*
*weeg*

indeed
therefore i must move on from my First Toe Bro
and i must spread its word onwards
i am simply but a humble servant of the Toe
however
he's the owner of the region
and now i have a toe bro, and a position open to me
i just got on and said my toes are leaking
i havent even read their constitution
they offered me an officer position for the region
*civil rights lovefest*

I MADE A TOE BRO

they later explained it was a sincere mistake
i was banned from there after my post
for the no toed boys
that was part of the welcoming telegram to that region
anyways
i am merely a messenger
i was simply copying and pasting it
that wasnt me, that was these guys https://www.nationstates.net/nation=what_doth_thou_meaneth
well personally i have to say my life has improved since reading it
yeah
well you're missing out
for it is not mine
i shall not claim responsibility for such a masterpiece
you should be laughing
i know
There is, in reality, a considerable amount of tasks, ventures, and challenges that can be accomplished by living organisms on this particular planet, as well as a considerable span of items that can be registered by the visual organs of these life forms; therefore, it escapes my extensive range of understanding ...
The prospect of surviving for a purpose that was not intended to be entertaining did not successfully parse the orderly, logical depths of my chief executive sensory organ; this aforementioned organ, when left to undergo mitosis and extend its reaches and capabilities over the passage of time, will have its power increased by a considerable amount, but the organs surrounding it in the bodily appendage it is contained within (“head”) will decrease in neural connection power in a fashion that is described as rather like losing the ability to generate speech with one’s vocal cords.
I suppose that the measures of time taken for the planet Earth to perform a complete orbital rotation around the central solar body whose sphere of influence it is snared within, which last approximately 365 and one quarter of a day each, begin such an action as perambulating through time, and that this perambulation, or “coming”, shall never cease or terminate in any way; I proceeded to leave the solid, firm surface beneath me in order to appease the regulations intended to boost the effectiveness of order in our chaotic universe, and went on to come into such contact with the surface of the planet’s crust as to bring my negative kinetic motion along the Z-axis to a complete stop, but to allow the specific form of my perambulation that is performed with haste along the XY plane to increase and to carry me along the surface of the planet by using the muscular appendages extending from my hips for the purpose of accomplishing this action
This member of the genus Homo, the species Sapiens, and the subspecies bearing the same name as its parent species, who identified as the female gender, was not appearing outwardly as exceptionally intelligent, with her pointer, or second, finger, along with her opposable thumb, or first finger, forming the sculpted body of a capital letter “L” in the English alphabet, or “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L” in Unicode, this all taking place on the upper area of the facial portion of her personage.
A fellow human being once informed me that the very planet that I stood on would be executing a kinetic circumnavigation around its cosmic axis, and that I would play the crucial role of being the secondary turning point in this aforementioned circumnavigation; I am not the implement with the angle farthest below ninety degrees in the storage unit for such implements, also known as a “small residential living area” or “shed”.
i must sing a song dear to my heart
excuse me

I eat lunch and dinner
I just don't eat breakfast
***NO***
NO
it's a bit rare to have four on at 3 am
weeee
yeah
I don't know what you're talking about, it's almost as if you are saying that what flirting is is simply letting your affections control your actions and showing how much you care that way, this also means we all flirt in our own ways almost as if its unique to your own personality, and as such the thing should come naturally or flow and work in a certain way that may be entirely special in of itself, sam

I've made much more progress than her
yeah not to brag but

I wasn't lying after all
Shelby can explain
*what?*
that's not
no
sam
er
that
on what foundation is your doubt set upon?
why I'd stake my life on it
I needed a professional my dearest Sam
I needed it for my midnight course

it's a fun word
frickle
ha
thank you I worked hard
frickle a nickel pickle my little fiddle doesn't play a fiffle none more
I need to start saying that
that would make more sense
ah i guess it could also be used in that context
"frickle my pickle"
there was no way I couldn't make it into a euphemism
that's why I refrained from saying pickle at first
oh frick jenna frickled my dad's pickle and boinked
oh frickle a nickle my dad committed tax fraud
frickle is great
frick is standard, boink is usually used in a sexually context, and through frickle in there for a little spice
I have multiple variations with different meanings
Jeffrey can go boink himself
Jeffrey is just quirky like that
his wife boinked the mail man
if people actually used that
the world would be ten times better
in place of them
I wrote that off on my notes in science
boink and no-boink?
what was sexual and asexual reproduction

why would you want statbot perks of all things
its simply a matter of activity

i'd rather blow my own brains out
wat
byee
frickle
it may actually induce a feeling of uncomfortable, incredible sadness, and fear all at the same time
w o w
let alone a funeral
i cant express how completely unfitting sea shanty 3 is for anything
jesus
thats what i expected
do you have sea shanty 3 on there?
wait
and then boom

*may you come back in harmony with thyself and everything*
*farewell fair student of the enlightenment*
*i wish thee luck on your spiritual and personal journey*
i would say i am "woke"
so yes
I have awoken to a higher state of consciousness, for now i can see all for what it is without interference from any typical bias or influences of that sort
*once the truth is fully unveiled and the deep, world shaking revelations come you will realize how obvious it has been all along*
*even basic logic*
*space*
*time*
*for this transcends all boundaries*
*it will feel like a millions years and just one second at the same time*
*listen closely*
and thusly made me prone to the average self destructive nature of humans
and how my belief structure was fundamentally wrong
now i can recognize the folly of my ways
now i can recognize the misguided road i strolled down, naively content i was simply following the path that was the easiest but not the truest
for the better
my worldview has changed
i have been enlightened
that video was a holy experience
how fitting
guten tag
and thusly miss so much
otherwise you might miss the meaning
listen closely
thats why you listen
but im loving this deep dissection of a 90s harem anime
this combined with the conversation and the fact i've gotten very little sleep is making a very surreal experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8MbwOfS6kA
also i've had this playing in the background the entire time:
ill go for crickets
its making me a wee bit queasy
i think i'll stay away from worms at the moment
i bow before thee in an effort not to be smited
***ITS IMPOSSIBLE***
**n o**
thou shall burn upon a pyre of five hundred skulls
holy bejesus you'd have to be god to have that level of sneak you heretic
sneak 100
thats a real bamboozle
oh frickle pickle

every species at every place and at every time will be exterminated
im even willing to go so far as to hand out genocide in all four dimensions
you can't have a problem if you're dead
its actually pretty helpful to any species with a problem
its impossible to have a downfall of your species if your species is wiped out beforehand
yeah
we are gonna hand out mass extermination of species left, right, center, up, down, and any other various directions
yeah
for their own welfare
its for their own good
they dont have a choice
we are going to force genocide upon them
in fact we are so generous
~~unless you are human~~
we dont discriminate
genocide for all
galactic genocide sounds fun
byee
im not sure, the address seems important
i can just find out
yeah everyone knows where you live now
times and place and plan is all good
yeah

that doesnt change the fact he doesnt know your mom
not the inappropriate part
the reason my dad said no is he doesnt know much about the supervisors we are getting
thats a nice quote
hes not talking about that
thats five years out
i dont see much sense fighting for it either
i should've seen it coming because he's awfully irritated due to having stayed up a very long time investigating a shooting
and its a no from my dad
me parental guardians are talking about it
i havent heard anything from my dad yet
they wouldnt know
yeah
yes because a bunch of 13 year olds can effectively smuggle alcohol
she essentially told me to "text my dad"
also my mom agreed
unchristian like things
ill ask in a momento
do i need to know anything else?
so at 6 till sometime tomorrow, camping out at sams house?
so continue onwards
once you all agree on definitive plan ill ask my parents
i dont know where they come from
i hear them regularly
woag

it may take quite a while

fear of death isn't the only reason

you should be

you tend to be biased and blinded to it
you shouldn't always trust yourself with predictions involving yourself
unless you can see into the future
you don't know that
loneliness in the crowd kinda thing
it's pretty universal
some people are bad at it others are good

I'll come back once I've passed page four hundred
I need to read
and I just remembered I forgot to connect screenshots of my furnace room in minecraft at full go
I do need to go though

i dont think hitler really bombed the jews
i'd cry
because i have a slight understanding of the world religions
they probably condemn such behavior in fact
i dont think thats what jews do
id rather not
he also died in 1945

how do you know he had nudes?
i personally believe hitler was female

I should bring teeth to school someday

you could probably gnaw on them
I mean they aren't useless
a kid walks by during an Easter egg hunt and all you hear is rattling and clattering
casually buy baskets of teeth from your local teeth dealer
that makes sense

mill?
you don't have to watch them now
yeah
weeg they are pretty long
the royal family one actually managed to change my mind
and so far the mental health one has made me cry without fail each time I've watched it so warning there
i watched the brexit one and was intrigued so I watched further
the royal family one and mental health one is asserting a position
it's just suppose to make you think mostly the brexit one
alrighty
a pretty good one on the royal family
he's got a brilliant video on suicide and mental health
philosophy tube is a pretty good channel
https://youtu.be/Vr-ZeToI4R8
wait a momento
though let me recommend a video that is my main source for the topic (and it's much more interesting than me ranting, i.e. it has costumes)
I don't care
I'm also done talking
I seriously doubt due to human nature that we could make a flawless system
and yet it decides our everything
government is a tricky thing
so he was also a racist
and of course he got to decide who were barbaric
no barbarians could
he of course thought only proper beings could vote
this meant he was a womens rights activist for the vote
maximize peoples happiness by allowing more people to vote
but they had a utilitarian approach
there was a liberal philosopher whom I can't remember their name
who gets to decide that
and to go back on to the only educated peoples can vote
and those who hold that power decide the fate of the future rulers
everyone has a bias no matter how small
but who decides what to teach the future leaders?
sometimes a good autocracy is better than a failing democracy
an intellectual guiding a nation
so why not groom someone from birth
not necessarily lead
all that elections guarantee is that the elected official can win elections
leadership is a skill that elections don't guarantee a leader will have
I mean
plato favored a state of philosopher kings
should we even have educated people have the democracy?
or is it a right you earn?
is the right to vote a birth right?
should your right to vote me taken away simply because you don't understand enough?
that makes the question arise
and yet they still vote
and the fact of the matter is that not all americans understand politics, civics, government, or maybe even basic rational reasoning
any reasonable person would say the educated ones
or let the educated, navigators decide
if you had to decide would you let everyone on the ship decide where it was to go
he used the metaphor of a ship at sea
or at least he was high skeptical
you know Socrates despised democracy
and yet those percentage of people get to decide what the rest have to deal with
maybe 19 to 18 something
about 20% of the u.s. population voted for hillary, and trump is a little lower
either way if you do the math
I think
the voter turnout for the election was roughly 59%
around mehhhh maybe 75%
do you know what percentage of people living in the us can legally vote?
anyways
alrighty it's gone
thats strange
owwww ringing ears
they say it's the rule of the majority when that's usually not even the case
democracy is such a flawed thing some times
iif
aaf
oof
oof I'm still alive
thank you so much for yet another gem peppa

I like the simplistic ones
also my favorite is geru

it was pretty entertaining to listen to
so naturally they took that limited time given to fly fish
one night they awoke to a columbian drug cartel member firing into the air, told them they had a 24 hours to leave or die
but they gotta have their fishies so they did anyways
he said one episode locals told them not to travel further up the river cause a drug lab is located there
but something always goes wrong somewhere
like Columbia for example
my dad apparently watched this show about these regular guys fly fishing in extravagant areas
I'm not sure
but w h y
I think you just got confused there
third book three books
a book a year
sometimes I envy those who got to explore it in its rawest form
I dunno
it's so perfect
god I love harry potter
that is far ahead, and we need not worry till it shows up on the doorstep
indeed
but I think you'll at least be able to appreciate it
and harry is a force of nature so you may have some trouble understanding him
just sciency
it's not necessarily wordy
plus you can drop hpmor if you don't like it by chapter 10 or so
you'll get through it
weeg
my god your actually reading
you have the methods of rationality lined up as well
that'll be a long time
that would be torture on your soul
now that
what if I got you to read Lord of the Rings
oh my god
it's really not that much
it's what happens when you don't turn into a nerd before the age of nine
but they are still great in their own right
*and there is so much depth it's almost annoying*
sure they can quite convey the depth of the books
but the movies are masterpieces
I just got to jazz covers
that's funny
it's been a while
I need to watch the movies again
I need some frickity frackitying Lord of the Rings music on here
also
how strange
im typing a response, almost as if I'm awake
I'm sorry all I'm interpreting is just snores
I wouldn't hold it against you if you fell asleep after you finished
that's strange
it only has 1k views
where did I even find to autumn?
but home
ill accept that
*I don't even need this measly playlist*
*you dare underestimate how long ill listen to home for?*
*I refuse*
I have like six left
oh dear I'm nearing the end of mine
weeg
I'm just listening
I'm not even purging
woag
but jesus it screams it at you but in a way you don't notice
yeah
she's literally falling nearly the entire thing
the symbolism is every where
I should've known kaori was gonna freaking die as soon as I saw the intro
but I can't believe how blind I am
that was almost an accident
and just to appease myself I finished the last episode on the first minute of april
also I rewatched your lie in april like over a month ago to have it untainted by sea shanty 2
did you ever end up watching the imitation game?
a your lie in april song came along so I've been listening to that
my head is empty
I'm as clueless as you
not too forced but weeg
we need to do something together eventually
weeg
oh what I owe to discord
it's felt like a long time
no I understand
I think it goes without saying, but I love you
weeg
or particular moments
especially for nights like these
I need a playlist of just nice, dreamy, calming music
A h E m
a h e m
I got married life going
nah son
THE COINS ARE GIVING ME A BRAIN TUMOR
I CAN'T IGNORE THEM ANY MORE
SKIIIIIP
NO COINS
NO COINS
home
I need a playlist of just nice, dreamy, calming songs
I am a good playlist upkeeper who constantly tends to it
I'm not sure
I'll have to listen to it eventually
it's shaaaaaaring
it's not stealing
eventually ill entrench myself
the more I listen to my playlist the more I fall in love with it
weeg
I have saved my phone once again
gh

SHOOT
WE MUSTNT SPEAK OF SUCH SINNERS
SHHHHHH
some undertale songs are just perfect
*it doesn't exist*
your device is faulty fool
I didn't see anything like that
how
how a comment section manages to keep the same tune is beyond me
it's interesting stuff
weeg
but still
maybe it's not right to say apparently, because admittedly my dad did the same for my sister
like everyone has a parent who sang this to them apparently
it's the most pure place on earth
not gonna lie I have you are my sunshine for the comment section as well
I didn't think about it that way
that's true
if I get another simply piano ad I'm punching my ipad
we all know they are the superior species
what a good rat
is it working?
a master manipulator at work here
weeg
but probably
your choice
jesus they are agents of chaos
sounds like a good plan
alrighty
mmmm blueshift is pretty
I think that would make me cry at are you happy again
there are very obvious tone differences
to see the progression as an artist he took
it would be an experience
I'll get him his own maybe
he just doesn't fit
I need to purge bo from my playlist
weeg
your all too welcome to join
and home playing
I need a home during winter, that is small yet homely with a nice fireplace
I don't need clever sexual innuendos after those songs
I need to start making playlist for separate moods
gah
bo is a very sudden change
exactly
the other jokey one
one somber one
cut it in half
separate the body
two separate funerals
easy
weeg
cause that would be a legitimate tear jerker
do you have it added to your funeral playlist
it's genius that's what it is
but you get my meaning
not a word I just figured out
contentness
oooh I got a well fitting word to explain it
it's lovely
with the minecraft music and home now I've been getting such a dreamy and peaceful mindset these past few minutes
weeg
HOME
YES
ahhhhh
I keep getting the same ads
I'd rather not
let me read lotr please
just
mrs walters knows I'm pretty smart (sometimes)
I mean my lexile can't get higher
I can just opt out, can't I
we probably will
anyways
MINECRAFT MUSIC
AHHHHH
but that doesn't make me any less mad
trueth
if school didn't provide my only social communications face to face I would much prefer home schooling
aghhhh I hate it
I need to work on reading counts
apparently
also they sound like agents of chaos
was he successful?
not gonna lie I really only have it to read the comment section every once in a while
the feeling of reading that while having somewhere over the rainbow play in my left ear is so conflicting it nearly gave me a stroke
**then e.t barfed on the eagle and it died, which seemed like a bad omen**
back in the 19th century witty impressions was the high comedy then
modern comedy is a masterpiece our forefathers would be proud to look upon
oh jesus christ
ahhhhh
I'm deaf
that's loud
holy crap
**demons**
wat
perhaps
the genocide must happen
it's reached a whole 40 songs
but my purge still needs to happen
~~actually its gonna probably backfire and make me more tired due to a lot of them having different tones, most not energetic and more so emotional or with emotional connotations~~
FEED MY LIFE FORCE
May my music invigorate me
I'm going to conduct my purge
that might put me at a disadvantage here
alrighty
I'm still refusing
weeg
I might fall asleep
I can't watch all 12 tacos
it's killing me
I can't handle this
indeed
IN THE EIGHTH TACO HE SAID HE WAS PROUD TO HIS SON
OH HE SPOKE
there's a whole four minutes left
plus this dad is only half way through
I don't know if I can handle any more
waT
watches
while he just
and then his dad proceeding to eat 12 tacos
I'm watching a kid come out to his dad
I won't ever get over the surprise of the initial jfk video
heartwarming
weeg
snap his neck

https://youtu.be/yeQ7MdhH-4c
oh god I found a really good one

https://youtu.be/nORv34CSYv0

weeg
https://youtu.be/cwwK7NmfF9w
well it doesn't matter

OH
I doubt that
well that doesn't change the fact your break first
you can't lie
I think you do
you are more tired than me
12 whole minutes
and I refuse
it's 12:48
incorrect
that would be smart
I'm rewatching patently stupid because I love watching the same five videos over and over again
*he deserves nothing less*
w o a h
*ahem*
***Jesus. Heidegger did ghag***

I've lost my good hand
ah
what are thou cards?
I wasn't paying attention that round
***interesting card shelby***
well now you have to tell me which one

mehhh cards against humanity is only occasionally surprising
I'm assuming
they are picking strategically
they want to win not have fun
***interesting***
sure
I just can't use a card
it appeared
according to the game
apparently I don't have a hand
ReeeeEEEEE
and I'm glitches out
there is cheating happening
*nooOooO*
*grandma*
count chocula

I knew that would win
why?
*I expect the best*

*you shall be judged*

interesting to say the least
***AIDS***

I'm sure weasley incest is a whole community of its own judging off the people who write the fanfics
oh the depths can be terrible
the ideal weekend
weeg
cause the series has attracted so many
it's kinda sad sometimes
the fandom is simply terrible if you go to the right places
cause ebony has so much character
there was one snape harry one for sure
drarry

i think that a new disney movie should be about a disney princess on death row
http://wikileaksorwhatever.com/

these mere scribbles shall not satisfy me
i only accept high quality paintings in ms paint
i would
STAY BACK DEMON
BURN IT WITH FIRE
KILL IT
now you've seen a green cat

*must*
greenish purple must be on there
rAiNbOw
weeg it gives you the template on which to build commands
on command prompt
isnt cd the command you use to navigate to files?
i know for certain i've done nearly the same thing though
probably
fun fact i once wrote a batch file that purposefully crashed my computer
im sure windows has a list of commands
or
do you not know how to direct into like files and stuff
well what else could you do
how the heck do you even code something like that
good job
I'll be getting on my computer so I'll probably finish wogharts
probably
yeah
the whole two messages on gryffindor

the gryffindor common room is so sad
weeg but I haven't went in there
if Shelby gave me permission to come into the hufflepuff common room am I allowed to?

oh that's nice
ravenclaw power
MY SWEET GRAPHS
GRAPHS

and I'm alive
magic
bye
I should be getting sleep
join
she helped a little
then I'm booting you out cause I'm not finished
I'm gonna let you peak in to answer your question
no I'm not
why not?
ill answer afterwards
ill let you into the Harry Potter server in a moment
momentarily
is this really prompted by me giving over kaiser?
I don't pick favorites in my spare time
I'm already a pretty rude person it wouldn't change much
I'd rather not
for real
now bye
simply a coincidence
bye shelby
hm?
I guess that's for the best
yeah
I should probably be dead though
only partially
I should probably fix this role thingy then
byee
anyways im going back to sulking introspection again
yeah you can I found a way
I'm a bit busy placing too much value on a fictional series and all
again I'm in the midst of a mental break down
yup
I know
did she do something
wat
kkk
you do have it
but she was in fact the first writer to become a billionaire
I'm pretty sure she lost her status to charity
now I'm actually having a mental break down officially
why am I still online
I name the ko-kaiser my regent
I'm sorry but I'm going to be having a mental breakdown
oh he has a rich backstory
voldemort yes

I'm aching
***witches DON'T RIDE MOPS***
***BROOOOOMS***
THEIR BROOMS
THERE NOT MOPS
bye
im done
YOU KNOWWW NOTHING
I MANAGED TO WRITE A PARAGRAPH
THAT'S THE FIRST SCENE AND CHAPTER
one of the very interesting things notable about the beginning of the novels compared to the film's is that the book series starts off from mr. dursleys muggle perspective, slowly easing us into the realm of magic instead of anything abrupt, where as the movies start us right away with harry being delivered by albus, minerva, and hagrid establishing the wizardness and atmosphere of the movie series
I'M ABOUT TO EXPLODE
I SWEAR TO GOD
IM GO ING TO KILL MYSELD
that's, thats what it is
it's platform nine and three quarters
***AGGHHGHHHHHHHHHHH***
I'M ABOUT TO BREAK SOMETHING
***literally anything other than common knowledge***
cause I'm borderline seething
probably
you're insane
I'm sickened by your apathy
cause the movies just scratch the surface
even if you've watched all the movies the books are still worth reading
there is so much to dive into that you have no idea about
weeg that completely ignores the atmosphere, themes, characterization, sub plots, and million other things
the main stuff
das ist true
weeg
why not you fool
any specific thoughts?
I really need to start rereading them
how was the book
well
oh weeg
what at 11?
why?
I don't think so
cut off both the legs
amputate it
magic isn't real
yup
**aaaaaaa**
byee
late byee
oh
dad???
sleep is preferable to death
I'm very concerned and confused
goodnoot
and
I know when I went downstairs
you know what I mean
it merged the messages
but I didn't
it says I did
and hopped back on at 9:14
read a few pages of lotr
got ready
I left around 9:06
nope
im actually gonna finish up the permissions real quick now
I'm real close to finishing up the permissions
I really need to work on wogharts
weeg
alrighty
weeee
probably won't work but ill try
thats the plan anyway
and after that for a few weeks I'm gonna increase it gradually
so I'm starting by a page or two a day before bed
I'm trying to get myself into the habit of constant reading
but I am quite the linguist, whose sentences flow eloquently from word to word
it was unintentional rhyming
and with a few more pages of the fellowship of the ring read
I have arrived alive
ill be back in a few moments
i gotta go downstairs
i can agree with that
ah
chicken the cat?
guten tag
strange
alrighty

im listening to it while playing "My Little Pony 3D Roleplay" on roblox
alright not gonna lie this is actually pretty good
you really like jazz
hm?
various versions of megalovania
personally i believe this is a glimpse into the future of music
im not sure whether i like it there or not
because it sure felt like that
i prefer to think of it as a glimpse into hell
***ha***

I have the right to make a website about the various cucumber based laws around the world and through out history, that doesn't mean I should
I'm refusing to right now
no I don't
I'd rather not
I don't know what you expect me to do
right
probably
why not?
you ***really*** need to contact a doctor with this stuff going on
sure
stop it
again
I can direct you to the local witch doctor
not do that
ya know
you may want to
that's not good
**you're 13**

weeg
*electroconvulsive therapy*

electroshock therapy usually helps

oh my woes
*i can fix this*
i can fix this
i want to see the kids again
wanda please i hope you didnt mean it
me!
aha you know what's not an abomination?
¹  What's very interesting about this quote is that it's quite a common quote among Daves, and it was originally said by their great, immortal leader, and part time pouter, Dave (coincidental naming accident)
most say they are "suffering eternal damnation at the hands of their creator in these terrible, terrible flesh suits"¹
a few scientists say this is merely a fluke in evolution
it makes breathing, eating, swallowing, and life very difficult, miserable and short for Daves
this is mainly attributed to the fact that their lungs are in the back of their body, along with their stomach
this goes along with their very pessimistic attitudes about everything
Daves believe that they are in fact in hell
while many creatures believe that god has put them in the world, and if they do good they ascend to heaven, and if they do bad they maybe go to hell
so we shall call them Daves
however it sounds very much like Dave

its official name in their own language is
however some of their words do sound exactly like earthlings
now its language is not comprehendible to most humans
THIS

PLEASE WELCOME
moving on from one terrible thing to the next (please come back wanda) we have this *creature*
the debate is on going
the Radicals are a group that say its not very inclusive or accurate that they are the only species with the name "god hates me"
the Traditionals argue that in order to preserve their history they must retain the honor, traditions, and names their fathers gave them
now there is major societal and political rift in this species due to there being quite a few other abominations in the galaxy
"god hates me"

The first one up has very aptly named itself
now part one of this program will be focusing in on two particular abominations
we come to species
moving on from *Episode 1: The Universe*, and *Episode 2: A Few Absolutely Terrible Planets*
*GODS GREATEST MISTAAAAAAAKKEEES*

still something
while your doing that actually smart sounding and productive task, im going to watch netflix in my basement
gluten tagg
otherwise i probably would've taught myself highschool algebra by now
as soon as it takes me a little effort, or i feel my resolve drain just a little i drop the whole thing
i dont
thats my problem with sticking to plans:
that would be absolutely spectacular if you were to
your not gonna lose all too much if you fail
weeg
any commands in mind?
what are you going for other than harry potter theme
that takes actual coding
i feel differently towards it
weeg
but for some odd reason i've liked it more compared to the other times
granted i havent been reading for that long
also i've actually been enjoying reading lotr this time around
plus it is probably more helpful than another clicking confirmation thingy
weeg i suppose so
thats strange
why do you have to enter the server name to delete it
im backkk
dont mess up
you can add back the missing stuff
space doesnt matter
you guys can add that stuff right?
what else did we have
im adding them back though
i have no clue though
nope not really cause people mainly talk in this one
spookier
spooky
a few new channels
literally nothing is happening right now
its not chaotic whatsoever
weeg
im gonna slit my wrists
im gonna freaking end my life
***my god you suggested this you gjklsedrhgl***
i swear to god
thats the point
calm down
yeah ill get to that
like this one
im getting ideas as i go
im organizing this
WAIT
ill add that part of the common rooms later
most of the main stuff is on hell
i dedded them
and i intend to make a channel for every single one of them
a million different rooms and hallways exist
how absurd would it be to make every single room in hogwarts a channel
also
thats not very hufflepuff like
later ill manage the roles n' all
alrighty
jabob - hufflepuff
shelby l - hufflepuff
shelby n - ravenclaw
tyler - ravenclaw
gus - ravenclaw
ben - ~~gryffindor~~ slytherin
sam - gryffindor
cool
you unchristian frick
dont swear though
sure
i was just going to change him over to slytherin
you frick
ill fix it later
i dont need your support
the rich history
hell is under no circumstances getting deleted
ill work on it all
anyways yay time for rebuilding
we'll fix it later you frick
welp majority (minority really) rules
wrong answer
what virtue do you value most
alrighty
welp the poll is about to expire
but unfortunately not
if we could then i would be in both houses automatically
nein
slytherclaws are the best
oh yeah
you can stay with gryffindor for now
no
actually
what did you answer on the test
the ravenclaw power is uncontrollable
alrighty
nein
*bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity*
*so i countered with*
*he called you a coward*
alrighty you can be an idiot if you want to be

bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity
your the one who took the test
cool and good
alrighty
i dunno
can you please take that quiz
http://wizardmore.com/sorting-hat-full/
noice
we go with first answers here
you should just answer
you shouldnt try to get anything
thats not the point
lies
you liar
where the heck are they
i dont know
is no one else showing up for the vote
*yup*
the quiz speaks the truth
well too bad
people cracked the pottermore one for that
its the most accurate quiz
now thats a bad house
"Hufflepuff Pride Day is March 20th, Slytherin Pride Day is the 21st, Gryffindor Pride Day is the 22nd, and Ravenclaw Pride Day is the 23rd."
maybe
most people are boring
hm
its all the official pottermore questions
its the most accurate one
well take the test i pinned fool
okay

i took the test to make sure
im definitely ravenclaw
later
we will find out
i wont take head of ravenclaw
bold of you to assume i will take power for myself
slightly below
im like half slytherin
(which are gay)
ignoring my other houses in me
we'll figure that out
i dont know

http://wizardmore.com/sorting-hat-full/

ill do something brilliant I promise
weeg
ill perform some miracle to get hold of a lot of money
I can gather enough money
weeg
God I'm such a nerd archetype sometimes
I'd one hundred percent live in a grand library
I'm scaring myself by realizing I'd actually would think that's heaven, minimal exaggeration
I can live among the books
I don't need my own roon
I still demand a massive underground library
add a million more rooms and then maybe it could fit everyone
woag
alrighty
some stranger than others
we all have our likings
must still be painful

I'm playing with a line of cocaine again
oh look at that
I'll be back in a little
I'm gonna let this sit with you
anyways
that actually made me laugh
all he did was say more african children should die
I wouldn't say that much
that was interesting
it's something genetic that's what
**better than the wife**
I see where you get those random bursts of extremely dark humor
***not enough***
i just got ready

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuqM_9h6QY
well its worth it so its excusable
like self publish a book
maybe ill actually do something with myself eventually
thats also an expense
weeg
im kind of banking on being a brilliant success here
we can always expand upon it
i also demand a lab somewhere that is preferably not flammable
i demand my own library
alrighty
it'll make it more chaotic dont worry
at least im assuming
weeg
***clearly they havent encountered a naked mole rat before***
some may stay that raising a child is the most difficult yet rewarding part of life
you can do what you wish
i wont stop you
**own a naked mole rat trumps them all**
but
become god emperor
or maybe rule a country or two
like lead humanity into a new age of prosperity
i mean some are pretty ambitious
compared to others at least
what a spectacular goal
you dont want them to get lonely
**wow**
its worth it
weeg
**naked mole rats are the future of evolution**
**combine them**
weeg
i guess ill take your word
sureeeeee
*yeezys*

i can understand shelby n nearly dying, thats just her
i dont understand why that is some people's reactions

did I delete that
oops
Maybe the cup wouldn't have killed itself if it heard me talk extensively about my expertise in ground beef
***faster***
*run*
don't
run
something
a revolutionary
my ribs have cracked
badum tshhhhh
she was generic to say the least
nah
just couldn't work
differences you know
well the marriage wasn't going to last long
but yeah that did happen
interesting
errr
it was
it killed itself once it saw my face
would jump off a cliff at the drop of a hat
they are very moody
I have experience talking to cups
with all your soul talk to a freaking cup
weeg
lovingly
(screams and then silence)
"***IT'S COMING AFTER ME***"
"**it's alive**"
it's a liquid containment device
carefully thought out
I need to come with some stupid response to the question
really depends on whether your a cup half empty or filled kinda guy
one year closer to death
borth happ
I'm not getting super upset
he was being gus
I mean
well that's kinda what he wants
but frick you gus
fortunately such a thing can't ruined all too easily
quite a bit I would say
you can spill
a lot
we haven't
celebrated more by a few than others
quite a bit
really I'd be more inclined to making 4/22 a holiday
kinda both
weeg
4/21
weeg
I prefer room temp.
yeah
I love youu
so
oh also shelby I don't think I've met my daily quota
I'm incredibly curious
please do speak, I'm curious
what may that be?
it's not her fault
well you should be afraid of death
you kill me you die
or
I die you die
well it's death pact then
she'll find a way
yeah
I think your breaking
she'll get to you before the culling in that case
yeah
weeg
he's more than alright
you'd get murdered before the culling if I die
weeg
so if I die your going down in the culling normal time as well
the shear power
not me
it's more so the wedding doing that
yup
and you'll die during the culling fool
yes
still if your going to go to the wedding ill hold the culling back
what freaking pressure
she I think is exempt
weeg
the culling is gonna dodge her for now cause the wedding
and others can be completely exempt
it can be held back until then
there can be exceptions
oh
do you think it's possible to have the wedding like half way through the road trip randomly
**the music**
or
part of the band
definitely something to put down in the autobiography
I know that would definitely happen to me judging by how my memory works
do you think every time you see a rat you'll get flashbacks
*really what I want on such an important day*
*music to my ears*
because cutting people's lifespans in half is my hobby
deep fried butter is being served at the wedding
ill make you all emotional
I *will*
I'm pretty sure I can cry
you won't need to fake cry
wooo
oh imagine the speeches
we can figure it out later
**YES**
it's not too absurd to start wedding planning 5 years in advance right?
***wow***
aww
it's blurring the lines between heaven and hell
this wedding needs to be as surreal as possible
also can you become a pastafarian minister?
no need to worry
I have a feeling you will be best man
I do have the omnipotent sight into the future of a god
would it be morbid to make a rat themed cake as well?
ooooh
gus isn't gonna give you an answer
you are funny, but you don't have to work much becoming their best friend
well with that attitude your not getting invited gus
it's perfect
yess
like personalized though
do you think on the invitation cards the various rat memes should be on them
five years
legal age is 18 right?
they don't even compare
weeg
it's just a matter of time
weeg
if it's on sale
304 dollars for a *high quality* one
I'm keepin it
I want a rat costume jabob
but...
if i find one it's mine forever
***c A nD Y***
a rat costume?
say
please forgive me but were you missing,
but it's not exactly traditional
oh it's very important though
and I'm back
ill be back in a few minutes
i leave off on a high note

well i just made my last idea before i go downstairs
oHNO
i need to print off the *help* one and use it as a book mark
woag
a double whamo

just by simply glancing at the folder
i mean
i dont think im gonna get an answer either
the things im making is making me have some realizations about my sense of humor
i have such mixed emotions
weeg
its peaking out

*yikes*
*its confusing even me*
*i dont know*

also
no
genetically they are far away enough its-
cousins are alright
yes

you may have to put it down
it has a disease then
***i gotta lot more coming***
in a matter of a day they are now 50% of them
weeg
which is only memes i've made of course
im gathering this in my memes folder
*help*

oh what a time to be alive
and rats support jim
yes
there are no strange reasons to laugh on this server
**G**nOmEd!!!
IVE BEEN GNOMED
oh you frickity frick
then whats the point
is the gift a rat costume?
***they bring the recording to school to show off to their friends***
their reactions
and then showing it to the children
imagine recording such a wedding
jesus

how could you not like stuff like this:
these are the actual good conversations
weeg
*sewer rats*

**the universe knows what up**
**wow**
there is no way this isnt happening in some form or another now
magic and rats
magic
red wedding but more selective and a lot more rat involved
a few people didnt read the fine print in the invitation
weeg
it changes from happiness to fear very fast
***RAT***
my god this is news material
infinitely so
or new zealand
im pretty sure pastafarian weddings are legal in australia
well they arent stupid if you do them right
**ohno**
god i cant express my amazement
***WOW***
***woW***

*ohdear*
cause it could be easier to ignore if its the bottom half
the bottom half of a rat or the top
***w o  W***
i can work with **errr** ***rat costume*** wedding attire
not at all
***oh what the aliens would think***
***let these images be what we broadcast out into the vast and limitless expanse of space***
wait a momento
i need to make more
god
***i desire more candy***
and it **didnt stop**
also sea shanty 2 started playing
"do you wanna know where uranus (your anus?) is located?"
then she asked
it got a bit quiet for a little
"i killed a cat with my rad bat" - izzie
occasionally she just breaks
its not
shes gone insane
its interesting
ill send an audio recording later
i am very worried
izzie is either screaming or laughing
**HELP**
well thats part of the problem
help i dont know what to do
how much even is a minecraft realm
***yes***
when in rome do as the romans
yeah
well what was the whole point then?
oh
i can only pretend so much
weeg
i cant keep it up anymore
actually i think im fine
NEITHER CAN I

**wow**

*wow*

only the classiest of comedy
***i will***
i will
not related
im drowning
im vomiting
i cant contain my anticipation
i cant wait till i hear sea shanty 2 blasting
im proud
its pretty high up there ill admit
however
quite a few things could
im pretty sure he kept it in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH5rEvxFLvM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjjDOdaFZg0
if you need to know the contrast even more
weeg
***sea shanty 2***
then
like the theme to a fistful of dollars
ya know
he had me download all this serious western music
it'll appear in the soundtrack of the game as well
weeg
i sure did
i have snuck in sea shanty 2
so today
i have been making him dependent on me
if it makes you feel any better my dad has been coming to me to download music onto a drive that he can use on his baseball game as walk up music
yeah you weren't all too specific there
i go straight for the intense stuff
i prefer straight up acid though
weeg
it gets you high on *creativity*
bland paint
*my favorite*
soon he will be nothing but pudding
weeg
his insides are being liquefied by the power
Picasso would be proud
modern day art

i cant wait to give myself radiation poisoning
i think im gonna try and make a bomb in my basement
aghh im bored
two claps for that joke
wow
and then found another named east egg
i need to found a town named west egg
***all hail jim***
all hail jim
weeg

you get the gay?
woag
sure
ya know system of checks and balances and all
he doesnt have that much power
no i dont think so
there is frozen stuff in hell though
but not wet
weeg
something seems contradictory about calling something wet as hell
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
jeb bush is obama's 11th cousin
donald trump is obama's 13th cousin 6 times removed

also obama is queen elizabeth's 10th cousin thrice removed

electric boogaloo

sighhhhhhhh
your bones just need to hatch
byeee
(insert virtual non-gay hug here)
I trust you not to freaking derail yourself then
don't always act on them
emotions are temporary
I don't know what to tell you
that's why you eat the carrot now
now that's a risk
eating a carrot or two
satisfy yourself by
I dunno
weeg
at this age
those three years are big
you shouldn't be stupid reckless either
well don't
I can't peasant
I should make a new pie chart tomorrow
woag
weeg
but I've been falling asleep pretty early this week
if I keep talking I probably will be able to stay up a couple more hours
I can feel it
it's starting to fade on me
weeg
I should be dead asleep by now
an especially long week
it's been a long day
I don't know how I'm not that tired
that's all I saw
there was also the literal hand gun that was "no"
I couldn't understand it
weeg
it has been dedded
and I want it gone
but I'm scared
I don't know
ill just accept it
ill start taking that to mean I'm a god as well if you keep saying that
again I blame it on mental illness
demented, but funny kinda worried
well both my parents worry me, but in the schiller sort of worry you
I'm like them combined and toned down a few notches
weeg
they're the reason why I am the way I am, if you couldn't tell
it's something
it was great
he also jokingly said, "oh right, you can't be racist cause you have [cue mexican accent] *Aztec warrior blood in you*"
my dad proceeded to do an extremely offensive imitation of a certain type of Mexican American and I almost vomited laughing
it's perfect reasoning
weeg
oh yeah
but also "Jews, Blacks, and others"
not only against hispanics
my mom said that because I'm half Hispanic I'm therefore colored and can't be racist
also
I'm alive
its called moving with the times
welcome
i think

i can get the opportunity to poke yolk

**e g g**
how would i be able to do anything other than scream
i dont know how to even work a microwave
we'd burn it down
weeg
it would be like it, except almost everyone is an ethan
***wow***
but god
so you probably dont have to scrap it
i dont know whether i'd participate
i would watch it
actually correction
i'd rather gnaw off my own limb then witness and participate in that chaos
that would actually be the real hell
his name is fungus
oh nevermind
me and more new horse are being sucked into hell itself
its pretty self explanatory
order and chaos
well its a loaded question
with neutral
and good or evil
there is chaotic or lawful
weeg
benedumble cucumber does fit there in some ways
interesting
any idea for me?
but hard
that would be awesome honestly
that would be amazing
you should
minecraft update
woag
also
chaotic neutrals are gods
that'll have to be a yeeno from me
woahhhh
aww
weeg
your mom DID?
it looks like he lost 90% of his body mass
woag

oh also i didnt send this, but the Ledger of Perceived Slights came with an interesting card
awww
I'm scared
noice
that's cool
oh, aren't you confident
do you get an A
only if you've made a good egg memes
egg memes are worth it
weeg
I'm really tired so I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be awake
that's a justifiable enough explanation
well
you may need to do that
you clearly don't understand the extent to which they do it
so my abuelita gets worried way too much cause I'm not accepting being overfed
and I don't eat in regular intervals
they give you some more to eat
and once you are full
they love to feed you
that's another thing
really I was trying to run away from being fed
then we watched some people get hurt on youtube
like an actual intelligible one
we had a legitimate conversation about the future of fortnite
that would make things very awkward
oh how the mighty have fallen
he was the one who tried to get me to play fortnite
OH
I once played soccer with one kid whose name I don't remember
*yeahhhhhhhhhhhh*
soooooo
it's just a cultural thing
and cause they are mexican the traditional family matters a lot
it's the added language barrier, apathy, and seeing them for one blurry day in a blurry week of doing things
oh god I'm so confused during reunions in california
which makes some things awkward occasionally
I just don't bother to remember names
I don't know any of my less direct family even though family events do actually happen
well there isn't exactly a single short gene so it's going to be very complicated
I'm holding onto that while I can
they tell me they have hope for my height
I'm already considered tall in my family, we must have like minor dwarfism
I really don't think so
sorry it was perfect
it learns you know
well youtube's algorithm has the good general idea
measuring you? As in height?
I haven't watched chapter 1
I don't even know what that means
But what is a partial differential equation? | Overview of differential equations, chapter 2
or maybe
well, do you have Avoiding Negative Side Effects: Concrete Problems in AI Safety part 1?
give me what I want youtube
I just got math stuff in my recommended what the heck
maybe
maybe I accidentally brought her soul into my ipad instead of my no-good-for-anything-neighbor-jonathan
I did mess up a satanic blood ritual a long time ago
I don't know
that was odd
nevermind the witchcraft is over
I'm terrified help
it's glitches
it's possessed
actually I give in
STOP
NO
TAYLOR SWIFT
no point in understanding it then
weeg
cause my perception of time is all wonky
probably much longer
I ended up finding another song by the same guy, but that was a month ago or so
it's worthy of that
weeg
I remember really liking I fall in love too easily from your playlist
ah alrighty
so you do you
I think it sounds nice
cause I like piano
I have a disproportionate amount of piano covers
well you should put what you like
weeg
I've been trying to add more to my playlist for the **combat and natural selection between them**
i like it quite a bit
it is
only now that I've rewatched the theory of everything of course
I've found myself listening to the arrival of the birds quite a lot
thank
and
nice

screenshot
it actually works pretty well
is the ratio right
oh nice
the roblox and stock image ones are the ones I like
the rainbow comic sans was good for a background
your ideas are always brilliant in some way or another
kazoos?
***wow***
**my god**
may they be more kazoo based?
you haven't seen anything
oh I haven't even used the twenty kazoos I own yet
there is always new content to work with
I don't have much of anything
I need to add some fire power to my arsenal to counter yours
***I'm fearing***
***not the artillery***
***oh no***
that might be a problem
oh?
well it's good you've stopped feeling super bad
weeg
I'm just saying it's alright you don't have the realm yet and everything
well yeah I'm not saying you shouldn't ask
it's alright
minecraft is timeless
it's fine
it's great
weeg
but those are the general ones
some people have more specific feelings
Minecraft Music Feeling
all that good stuff
a calm and Zone of playing minecraft
a peacefulness
nostalgia of some kind
I just listened to some minecraft music so now I'm feeling that Minecraft Music Feeling
oh on a completely different topic
b
bye
byeeeeee
don't question the biology of it
well I'm very diabetic so mine tastes like a weird mix of candies
it's normal
I think that's just my lungs though
air tastes like blood
**breathing is good**
**ohno**
**SUDDENLY YOU BECOME HYPER AWARE OF YOUR OWN BREATHING**
sorry

one of those things you notice more when your told or talk about it
it's terrible
pesky exclamations
thank you
you have dignity shelby
my god
why have you spread your illness
why
my god
I have too large a range
thats pretty gay
I got 1% gay
that's a constant
except gus
so no one is here is gay anymore
sexualities are flipping a lot here

wait a moment
hmmmmmmm
this is all very confusing
**gayyyyyyyyyyy**
ha
I apparently need to rewatch that video
right
I did
OH RIGHT
do two gays make a straight?
apparently
if dank memer doesn't lie then I have quite a few things to think about
well shoot then
fair enough
well it's random each time
welp turns out I'm gay

is that an official statement?
not really
of course
thanks for the info
oh shoot son I didn't know
me or the yolk?
I need to find the picture of the girl poking the yolk but online somewhere, somehow
***I shall smite them all***
burn berries
I don't expect to come across weird stuff a bit if you know what I mean
cause I expect weird stuff to be made
I'm most unsettled by the fact it somehow managed to find its way into this discord server of all places
that is nothing
oh there has definitely been worse
I realized what I was watching, and gave in to it being pretty weird
but as it went on
I've seen some weird stuff
I didn't find it that bad
jesus christ
the sudden bright colors almost gave me a seizure
six episodes in I already got distracted and have failed
alrighty
goodnoot
well, people had a reason to hate dwight which is more common than people hating someone not very deserving of it like jerry
or dwight was more realistic
jerry is a less fleshed out character than dwight though, from what I remember
weeg
I'm rewatching the office, and is it just me or is jim sometimes incredibly cruel to dwight
**th**
I will though
I don't want to if you act like that
I'll give you four next time
byeee
maybe
even taking into account there are two shelbys that's absurd
that's excessive
shelby has been said 1783
there's definitely more
I can probably find other instances
weeg
I don't think it's the first time
oh god
I need to learn that skill
what?
put a space between each letter and asterisk
it won't work buffoon
goodnoot
but yes
seeing someone else in death would be interesting considering the lack of evidence in an afterlife
anxiety is exhausting

you tend to be a pretty good person, and something tells me the legal system isn't screwed up enough yet to get you in prison
weeg
weeg
I thought not
thats right
ah, but do you know the row that barry's parents were sitting in during his graduation ceremony
that sounds right, or an accidental crime
weeg
that'll come into use later
well you didn't
welp
it would take effort to top that
you really couldn't have been any more suspicious
wow you
you couldnt be any more suspicious
wow
weeg
*wow*
I'm expecting a tunnel system
I prefer to call it my one true god
it's worthy
***wow***
it's pretty good
I'm not going to dignify that question with a proper response
in literally every way

OH

fair enough
i let my dark side get the better of me with that one

"we have normal incels, then we have half-incels" - valefisk 2k19

"now the incel has two more sub-species to mate with"
another quote later on i think
god i hate it
***oh my god the chad imperiuM***
its hard for all of us
you are aware those are two different species right?
thats possibly the first time its ever been said out loud
the incel mines is a terrifying concept i hate

they may kill you

***I MUST RELEASE MY TEETH***
my teeth are what matters
but my teeth
the rest of my body can rot away
only the teeth though
i want to make my teeth **better, stronger, faster**
possibly
accidentally brush your teeth
though to be fair its not all too smart a thing to do
maybe
it turns out that im not the only idiot in the world i suppose
weeg
and i just gave in and brushed my teeth
i put on the toothpaste to the toothbrush and realized what i was doing
did you brush your teeth?
by completing another basic task
i have somehow failed at accomplishing a basic task
and left
ended up brushing my teeth without noticing
got distracted once i was in the bathroom
i went to go to the bathroom
im so confused as to what just happened to me

byee
that's what I thought
am I supposed to be disgusted, impressed, or just not care anymore?
byeee
!!:!! is my favorite time
weeg
it looks like souls crying out in a dimension of pure pain
an image from a deeper circle of hell
bye
ah
your terrifying
god is creepy man
there be demons here jim
goodnoot
just most of it
it won't happen all night
***a***
you are so misguided
or as I say, "he genocided a bunch of africans"
lil stuart is responsible for the rwandan genocide
***ONE OF US***
compress your spinal cord please
weeg
aw yeah
weeg
i still like my blue one a lot
Oooooh thats nice
crouton adolf terrorist
there you go
adolf hitler
aww nice cat
and i absolutely love blue
***iTs vErY BLUE***
it also moves

i found one i love
it should
we are just sending pictures of space
subtle movements
it moves slightly
it doesnt capture it perfectly

ohmygodijustgotanamazingbackground
***MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM***
you are either saying this to be intentionally destructive, or you are stubborn, or you are daft
there are more concerning issues to deal with than the long term survival of humanity
coolio
and remember them
i legitimately have seen some of these pictures before as well
weeg
that doesnt make them not pretty?
everyone deserves to see spacey stuff
like you can get moving backgrounds with wallpaper engine, i should actually use it
i need more spacey backgrounds
this is a very big disagreement

and yes i have seen pictures of hypernovas
well now i wont
i might have to ban you
**but supernova weeeeeeeeeeee**
and we can
it matters whether humans can
it doesnt matter if you cant go to space
also good job on thinking of humans as a whole

its pretty
but thats beside the point
also its because space is the final frontier of humanity, and its very symbolic to the future of humanity
oooh i gotta find some supernova pictures

ive got pictures of space bubbles
wait a moment guys
ha
buffoon
words cannot be owned
weeg
this is too far a gap that i cant bridge
sorry
i cant be your friend
space is really a beautiful
weeg
im glad
weeg
i love them

i got some pretty space pictures
all odds on the front
i can tolerate brighter shades of gold
white
greenish purple
pink
red
blue
guten tag
byee~
**now we play that in a loop**
very interesting
yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLqAFIMgpIU
also this has reminded me of something
and you get pushed into **The Pit**
otherwise you dont get paid
its just capitalism
and if slavery and back breaking child labor is part of that, its what has to happen
yup
**he must use the next available work force**
collapsing out of exhaustion
girlscouts dying in the factory
i think its perfectly normal
its your brain unconsciously wanting to read about an aggressive slave campaign
bye
i dont know much about his policies though
weeg he's cool
oh alrighty
are you talking about pete buttiegiegiegieigiegiigeigi?
wat
***I CAN USE AINT ALL DAY***
im just going to ignore that part of him
i aint calling no weeb my tech daddy, elon musk is exempt from his sins because of his elon muskness
i know i intended to have someone be disappointed in me
thats what she said*
coolio
oh dear
i dunno
hopefully
byeee
woag
yes
but i dont wanna do math
they are the same
he would be spared
elon musk is elon musk so therefore he is absolved of the weeb status
exactly
elon musk is my tech daddy
a four year old robot?
if you cant pass it your a dumb
neither did i
i use it to do negatives
i dont have a calculator with me
oh frick son it is
-3 minus a negative 4 is a negative seven
2/3x^7
i dont think so
yup
yup
yup
yup
thats right
yeah
that would be a good idea
yeah
**you aren't?**
wait a moment
i just remember the blue loraxes from near the end of the year in math, i think sam ran into the wall at some point
**dr seuss is dead**
weeg
a moth
yeah
not too talkative
your memory is faulty
kinky doorboi
cause shelby
and thats what came out
the birthing place of blue loraxes or whatever
making a story each person doing a word at a time
in 6th period we made a story on paper like the game we sometimes play
also the explanation:
that does not constitute enough for me to have contributed anything significant
i did the words "there" "a" "who" "he" "too" "please" and "said" i think
the 'kinky doorman and boy' was all you
i filled in just a few words
you made a story
nope i just have an incredible memory
is the correct version
'once there was a kinky doorman who hated kinky doorman. he loved kinky doorboi too, "please die" said kinky doorman'
and for your information
oh jesus not him
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
but
frick you beat me to it
guten tagg
weeg
thats not healthy
seeing holes
weeg
like the dominos arranged themselves that way due to demonic interference
it looks demonic
probably
hm
ohshootson
weeg
byee~
I just have to retract my previous statements
weeg it's fine
well if you said that I would've agreed with you
***wow***
I guess I don't fully understand
alright
it's still rabies
well it sounds like a wonderful experience until you get rabies
aw
*but have you ever seen a rat yawn*
sure there are amazing and spectacular sights all around the world
it sounds like it
a rat yawn sounds like something that could make you temporarily ascend to a higher realm of existence
weeg
I should probably get around to watching infinity war
Jesus Christ
and morning
have a portable home
easy
mostly ohno
weeg
yup
I know
*yes*
wait a momentos that reminds me of an idea I had
goodnoort
and start focusing on getting people *as high as possible*
I think science should stop focusing on cancer
our limit tilI we overdose on weed, or we just can't consume it fast enough
it's a sad human limitation really
one room, four hours, and about seventy tonnes of sweet cannabis
it's actually how congress think up of bills to pass
weed is really the explanation to everything
weed gives you telekinesis powers
that sounds about right
(now that I think about that, it sounds like it has to do with weed)
grass powers?
back from the grave
woag
guten tag
you freaking nonvascular plants
i know
thats so vague
"in multicellular they work together to make it"
it made more sense
is what they are trying to say
unicellular organisms have biological structures that are organised by specific functions, multicellular organisms are have cells grouped by function
ill probably remember it
so wats the question
well im incapable of walking
with what part
yeah
weeg
wat
fair enough
but ramen noodles are fantastic
lovely
it does
weeg

im not able to distinguish them apart other than one was born like three seconds ago
i just got puppies on minecraft
weeg
~~that i will never use~~
i have weights underneath my bed from my dad
maybe not that much
again laughing in the face of a little pain is normal
thats kind of understandable
you clearly underestimate the universe and the puppies
weeg
and pain is unpleasant i'd like to have you know
do you dare question them?
and the puppies are all knowing
aw
what a rebal
**angery breathing**
coughing is just spicy breathing?
wait a moment
i mean
weeg
it also gets small bits of smartie dust in your lungs if you dont do it properly or thoroughly
it is
i actually used to know how to smoke smarties cause of some nice youtube videos
that good ol' **snortie dust**
meth?
like its a miracle im alive
you wont believe how much meth i did
it was pretty neat
exactly
for your second place is an entire 5k below me
you mere mortal
im nearly to 40k messages boiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssss
i need to make a new pie chart
minor detail
but its there
not all the way
then hold a somewhat funeral
well
funerals
thats the solution to everything
hold a funeral
ripperoni in pepperoni
alrighty
ah
shalmo has taken up residence where?
***SHALMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COMEEEEEEEEE HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
***SHALALALALALALALALALAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***
***ALL HAIL SHALMO***
weeg
i prefer shalmo
pupils would melt
clearly
once they combine
everything in a seventy mile radius would be destroyed by the pure power of this new being though
well they are both unstoppable forces
the universe doesnt matter much anyways
well
vaporizes those pesky white walkers with a blink
basically a god
**elmo desires the iron throne**
i'd like to think elmo kills instead
its the rules
if ned stark, the most morally righteous character dies in the first season elmo dies too
~~or he'd get killed in like the first season~~

HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
I JUST FOUND THE CROSS OVER OF THE CENTURY
WOAH GUYS
jesus
weeg
suck it up
constant complaining
its just constant whining
weeg
they made the decision
screw those war vets
you'd have to be pretty stupid for that to happen
how do you loose limbs?
weeg
can't be that hard
true
most have two legs*
if you can't buy it you don't deserve it
can't the disabled make their own
but
it's vile
weeg
they are really scamming the disabled
***jesus***
I'll just use my cane
but that money probably should go into the road trip
can't be that much
no clue
shoot
your paying for the electric wheelchair
you've crippled me
carp
I actually can't walk
indeed
420 is a moment every person deserves to experience
EYYYYYYYYYYYY
shoot
420
**SAVE HIM**
but you die too
**no**
hurrah
**if the cat dies you die**
*quickly*
*free him you fool*
**the bois never die**
trueth
I don't see anything wrong with a bois take over
the bois can't be stopped fool
that there are multiple bois
I've never noticed that
my god it's spreading
weeg
no one will take away my minecraft time
I just need to stop walking
I don't need a nap
the world is mad
I'm dying
my legs are giving out
I don't know math anymore
**cool beans**
y sir
yay productivity
I'm not sure how much he enjoys it but
and your welcome
nice
I shall
I repeat plato has touched down
plato has touched the ground
probably
I hope you find them
I'm willing to say you need glasses to see
that may be a problem
byee
new things
new week
weeg
I don't want to amputate both arms
weeg
*ahhhhhhhh*
my right arm has been the one that's shut down this time
gluten taggg
bold of you to assume I'm not happy because I enjoy life
next week is us
I think so
I completely forgot about that
because I'm pretty happy
morning
odd
indeed
hell has been significantly more bright than it usually is
I'M IGNORING
I CAN AGREE WITH THAT
WHAT IN TARNATIONS
this was the plan all along
haha peasant
*insert squeal here*
same thing
I'm dying with laughter
**it's brilliant**
april the 22nd isn't particularly spectacular
woag indeed
april 22nd
ill be right back in a momento
indeed it was
***low blow***
***well you threw the first punch with the bamboo bean***
unlike *some* people
well at least my mother gave birth to me
you insensitive plant sniffer
she was a cricket
you mother crickets
okay?
you both disappoint me
you have a wrong sense of humor
name him John, The Destroyer of Worlds
all of it is being saved in a top secret facility
I'm gathering the evidence
either way
oh shoot son
**what do you have to say for yourself ms. ravioli**



I'm building quite the stockpile of evidence
only the illegal over the top mexican and chinese stuff
skydive while attached to fireworks
I would like to go out on a drug trip
usually it doesn't
yeah
weeg
your life is on the line
and this is why I can't be nice
I don't even want to know what your reaction would be if I genuinely told her she was great at something
I just said she was alright
but you aren't bad
I won't lie and say you are great
your alright
everyone can better see, and focus more on their flaws than others do
well that's kinda a thing with everyone
gluten tagg
how terrible do you think you are at speaking?
it's been useful
whether it be the 170 words from the short term memory thing, or the fact that I sometimes can get a very strong inclination on what a word means by now I feel about it
I find it strange how well my brain works with words
I find it funny what some people think is awkward when in reality most people don't notice, nor care
most people don't like awkwardness
just based off of shape alone
it communicates the idea very well
I don't hate it
what the heck english
separated by a k
two w's
they do seem a bit more awkward now that I've been paying attention to them more
also yeah
swoogles are magical
isn't that just swoogle
woah
it requires a deft hand and eloquence of a kind that is unknown to most
exactly
passive aggressive post it notes just seem right and natural
I don't think it's very odd
bye
leaving post-it notes on someones desk that are subtly agitated in tone
you know what the most passive aggressive thing you could do is?
atomic destruction and relief packages are the same thing
actually messing up talking is a pretty hard thing to do
lovely explanation
oh?
well I'm not planning on killing myself anytime soon so I'll still be here
goodnoot
oh alrighty
noght
I love him
he's my role model
https://youtu.be/jcq0J2iEHzw
help
I'm laughing
I have failed at crying
bye for sometime
I wanna cry again so I guess ill do that
**ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh**
probably
sure
but I get too interested in it
well you have a knowledge of history and cosmology so you can be interesting to talk to in that regard
bah
filling my mind with the french
but now it's all left my mind
I was gonna make fun of shelby a bit more
I had a talking topic prepared
you've drawn me off track
and I just realize I have no idea what I was originally talking about
plenty of people had their head cut off
and also
king louis the-too-manyieth
there is something deeply appealing about the contrast between blind national pride and the horrors of trench warfare
but cmon
they are the french
they can burn like their precious notre dame for all I care
YEAH
OH SCREW THE FRENCH
yeah
YOU TIN POT
I FOR ONE LOVE IT
*style*
https://youtu.be/u9JDqWC8gXc
but dude
oh also ww1 was the first global industrial war blah blah blah
style points that's why
cavalry charges
but you know what ww2 didn't have much of?
ww2 also had grenades
ww1 had more style
**it's overrated**
it's overrated
but
if you are asking seriously I obviously do, it established American dominance in a broken Europe, stopped the great depression, started the cold war, left a generation in ruins, and forever changed the geopolitical landscape of the world
ww2 is overrated
cool fact "large anime thighs"
cool
no clue
https://youtu.be/SZ2L-R8NgrA
this is why
and now I'm watching a video about jesus
I was just watching a video on britain's porn censorship bill
funnily enough
oh I'm sure it exists
bunch of christian propaganda
with a burning passion
I hate them
oh screw off pureflix
ya know
but
I mean, I'm a hypocrite
getting healthy sleep is a good thing you know
why would you want to break a good schedule?
"if your tired you should sleep" - a wise old philosopher
goodnoot
I like it quite a bit
I just am teasing
I know
okay maybe that was a bit sadistic
***SEE IF HE CAN SWIM***
it's beautiful
https://youtu.be/MqoANESQ4cQ
on a completely different note
I'll have to try that
I wish I had a mole man of my own
especially if they catch you off guard
that sounds terrifying actually
well it seems it would be difficult to conversate with something in your eye
**mole men are inside your eyes**
**ah**
ah
I think it's my brother
weeg
but something is actually in my right eye and life is hell and only pain
I really need those
I think those were the wrong knobs
oops my nose fell off
perhaps
I found two on my nose
where is the knob?
it's falling out
I think my right eye is a bit loose
fair point
are you sure that's rated e for everyone?
your profile picture is so confusing, simply because it contrasts with what you are saying
interesting
errrr
thats
what?
either way it doesn't matter
but if you do turn out to be a bad writer, you certainly will be creative one
goodnoot
how dare you assume I'd let such a thing pass
plus I'm your editor so how dare you
but you seem alright to good
I don't know how well you write
if you end up writing some I'd like to be both your consultant, beta reader, and editor
they really are
and I'm allergic to work
it'll take work
I really want to write comedic stories about Tom G. Guttley and John H. Smottley now
ah
roblox?
ReLaTaBLe
it's not that big a difference
you can just lie to people
I mean
weeg
close to what?
each year my birthday would be nazi and weed themed
sometimes I wish I was born on 420
indeed
if only
what?
interesting
your such an amateur
what's the point of blackmail if you say it immediately
cool?
**interesting**
everyday my finger itches to pull the trigger just a little more
whyyyyyyy
**now**
it
burn
when your at your friends house and you realise the overwhelming stench of butter and death is coming from the basement
absolutely no one
yeah
thats the sad part
insert deep sigh here
both are idiots in this case
why
luigi
hopefully the realm happens soon
~~or the roadtrip~~
that'll be nice
alrighty
gluten tagg
and im patient and im not even slightly irritated
if i want to be i can be patient
i cant speak for anyone else, but personally i dont mind waiting
its fine
please consult my grave when you get it
oh welp
i spent days camping out in the ruins of a temple just to freaking eat it and vomit it out in my creation
aghhhhh
itll be painful
i think ill do that
im gonna throw myself off a cliff
i've spent hours just gathering resources for the building and im out
frick frack
it happens
there are definitely worse ones
most boys are
this is kind of expected behavior
he's also a boy under the age of 17 jabob
yeah, quite a bit can change in a decade
i dont think we could really make any good educated guesses on who would be a good parent
yeah thats true
just balance of probability
at least some of us have to be bad parents
i dont feel like thats true
thats pretty immature
but children arent clones shelby
you having a child like you is a bit terrifying
*feed future child only lunchables*
ILL NEED TO WRITE THAT DOWN
YEAH
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
BUT GREAT
messy sometimes
THE PIZZA ONES ARE GREAT
LUNCHABLES ARE AMAZING SIR
making food is for ~~legitimately productive, rounded people~~ *nerrrrrds*
weeg
i always come back to the most wonderful things
**schmonkle**
smoth
there is plenty of better blood lines, but i do agree mine is pretty awesome
notre dame was gothic
that was classical architecture based on the ancient greek style
they arent anywhere close
***is notre dame freaking sand***
minecraft

getting away from children
***but shes old and wise***
*wise*
weeg
**mehhhhhh no**
and
either way it comes down to whether i want a child
*my amazing charisma*
which is a large assumption
also thats assuming any one would ever have children with me
it would be like izzie on steroids
my sense of humor, but imparted on a young child
but dont you understand
yeah most people do
it would just be morally wrong
i wouldnt want to raise such a screwed up kid into this world
and would be a terrible father even if i was the appropriate age
im still just 13
weeg
i'd rather shank myself in both wrists
dont worry its probably gonna die out on its own if i dont have kids
but the schiller family is relatively small
and there are quite a few others i dont know
the sanchez family is from my mom
the roth family if from my grandma
yeah im too awkward to do that, and i just dont want to go through the effort of social interactions
at my family gathering i sat in the basement and read for so long i had a bit of trouble walking to the car when we left
shhhhhhhhhhhhh
that sounds like it
well screw her that was actually kinda funny
weeg
my dad is singing about wanting plastic explosives as we speak
really the same thing
or at least a very specific sense of humor
im pretty sure mental illness runs in the family
again
weeg
apparently he responded with, "oh yeah i used to tell all my kids that i was born in a manger like jesus"
and my dad told my great grandpa about how in one of my slide presentations i put my face over baby jesus's in the manger scene and all that
i was over at the roth side of my family for a little bit
coming across a meme-y person who you forgot about is always scary
how so
well its something
i just like the word copious
weeg
i would continue to use the word copious cause thats cool
because i kind of assume people wont abuse it
i hoped so
i only prefer chocolate with an absurd amount of weed inside
mY HeRo SaNs UnDeRtaiL
**69**
what a sneaky
therefore people who have played fortnite must die sober
only good people of upstanding moral character deserve to die high
if you played fortnite you don't deserve to die happy
that's not the point
has to be april 8, 2024
nope
how old will you be when you die?
April 8 2024
your going to die someday
heeeeelp
kill me
I'm gonna disappear again
nice
eight hundred and three
later
steven hawking commiting murder
remind me later:
oooh that's an interesting topic
I just saw a child get ran over by a man in an electric wheelchair multiple times
lovely
ohno
I love stock photos
thank you
and thats what I came back to

sWaAGGLE
woag
thats sad
im actually happy considering the undeniably terrible event im facing in a few hours
*its your own fault*
well thats your own fault
other shelby
shelby obviously didnt
well i didnt
i just wanted to do a funny
its just a coincidence
or rather shelby made up
i understand its probably a euphemism, but its just a word i made up
you werent suppose to google it
have you heard of **swongling?**
try not to freak out but
he will
i know

*yes*
swoogleEEEEEEEEEEEEE
***SWOOGLE***
the made up word "swoogle" hasnt been said up until now
you know what severely disappoints me
you are contributing to the future robot uprisings
bot-ception
fair enough
but to be fair the odd ones do **heavily** outweigh the normal ones
probably more
well at least one with the easter one
that wouldn't have been odd
well what if i came back when they were talking about easter
just slightly though
i think the universe just dislikes me slightly so it makes make come back only to odd things
im not entirely sure either
why is that what i come back to
what the heck
das
i cant wait to go to a random extended family gathering and sit in the basement and read for five hours
weee
**ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh**
*interesting*
woag
woag
of course
beautiful
alrighty
why not
I guess there's no point in asking why anymore is there
weeg pretty much
all within view of each other
two lake
one lake (in distance)
one river
ill continue my point that minecraft deserts have so much water even though no one cares
byee
sorry
majority rule says your not a dumb nor dumb
very different things you know
therefore minecraft created minecraft
and minecraft is perfection
only perfection couldve made minecraft
indeed
minecraft dictates **nature's nature**
minecraft is my god
obviously
like a bunch
but yeah
probably that would be a good idea
i find it funny the abundance of water in minecraft deserts
alrighty
i cant wait for the death i crave
i wont
its what i would do
test the theory to give it evidential proof
eventually im gonna accidentally laugh for no reason at someone describing a relative of theirs dying even though i dont find it funny in the slightest
i dont know whats supposed to be funny or not anymore
im so sorry
i didnt exhale at all
disappointment pains sound like the worst
sounds better than sadness pains
that sounds like a body part
gloop?
gloob?
well thats a bit too close to foozal if thats too fun
i suggest foozal
come up with a new word
im gonna wait a while before celebrating
thats lovely
woo
thanks for clarifying
there were a lot of wilhelms
which one was he
what the hecc
alrighty
I'm like an hour into rewatching the theory of everything
alrighty
and why didn't my phone notify me
why was I pinged
magick
it randomly turns on
it's not my fault
stop or I'll kill you
I swear to god taylor swift
your gay
blahbyeblah
blah blah yeah yeah this has probably gone on for too long blah
plus I'm apparently playing roblox while saying this
same
indeed, I hope you live to see the next sunrise but not everything is guaranteed
au revoir, I wish thee luck on thy epic quest for comedic knowledge
not everyone is as adept in the art of comedy as others
you should've said sure just for the joke
I don't know anymore
ill say it again

I don't see why I would know

wait a moment while I fiddle around a little, go upstairs, go downstairs, then turn on the computer and send it
errr alrighty
I disappeared for a little cause I watched the most emotionally provoking thing I've ever watched in a long time and I accidentally came across it so that was fun
***alrighty then***
bye?
thanks?
how am I to respond to that
I don't even know anymore
yup I said that
you never cease to disappoint
oh dear
probably in some form or another
gluten tagg

I swear to god taylor swift
ohdear

burn everything you see in a frenzy of panic
hm?
alrighty
okay?
im so sorry for inquiring
why's that
I'm not even going to respond properly to that
I shouldve killed myself at 4:20 4/20
I'm so sad
I couldn't send the message to every server I'm on fast enough

gus stole brady's shoes and freaking ran around with them on his hand
i took three pictures in the cafeteria after school
it really does
**i have improved it**

i know
why
in like kindergarten
its a story in three pictures
i know
everyone is welcome to memeify the pictures as much as possible
your welcome



well I'm sure we have quite a bit stolen and confiscated from poland, france, and a few other places
take a chance with the third reich, we have stunning styles and dazzling designs

so goodnoot I guess
either your dying or your sleeping
does he alternate with the pope
so do like jesus host it
and decide to take a peak out of curiosity
you gotta be bored one day
like c'mon
no matter what your moral standing
weeg it really is
I'd watch it if it was on tv
oh yeah
that's laughable
bah
superhuman babies
nah
we need to keep it *realistic here*
weeg
well I was imagining normal babies
professionally trained warrior babies?
I don't want to see babies slobber on each other
it'll take years
how could anyone find that entertaining
he graciously give weapons to them
***YES***
I want to see jesus run a drug cartel actually
weeg
he does drugs, crime, shoots up a few places
I really want to find some kind of film where jesus comes back and does all the wrong things
all hail that bigg boi
indeed
I'm assuming that it's an aw
ahHHHh
mind blowing
woah
Gray and black

I like it when drawing guy is happ
aw
they don't, and missing one or two is usually the stuff that happens to me
I do worse at stems
I watched Jacob do the practice so I've definitely memorized them
I actually don't need to study for geography
I'll do that tomorrow
I forgot to study for both geography and language arts

I should probably get to the whole sleeping thing I was talking about
goodnoot
ohnO
how could he be not happ
but he still happ
his head is squooshed too
woah
and all legos are landmines
Kentucky doesn't exist
I'm tangled up in cords help
its a conversation starter
*yes*
I want him in every room I occupy from here on out
I want to pass him down
and I plan on keeping him forever
that
he is just
no
that fish is still on my wall
<:fish:568603590504218634>
*an inspiration to us all*
what a brave young man
imagine them telling their children about it
oh god
weeg
*kid reportedly default dances for ten hours instead of seeking out parents or lifeboats on sinking cruise ship*
they would totally t pose as they went down
also if some kid was stuck on a sinking vessel today
true
aha useless facts
F
if the titanic actually hit it head on it would've punctured less water tight compartments leading it to survive
fun fact
moments before the titanic hit an iceberg, leaving so many dead (colorised)
gluten tagg
indeed
I think alone they stand strong, but together they stand stronger
I knew what was happening instantly
it scared me
both pictures
oh my god that is perfect
ohno
cause I like that explanation
I hope so at least
basically
yeah
weeg sometimes it just happens
at home I have a cane that my neighbor randomly gave us like years ago
nah it's fine
I've told you about that
oh sometimes I kinda forget how to walk and stumble a bit
I just tried to pull myself out of my chair, and I guess I forgot how to stand
not much
so then I had to explain to my mom why I fell out of my chair while laughing
fun fact the reason it took me so long to get downstairs and back on discord is cause I laughed too hard at a spore video, tried to get up but my legs kind of failed me so I fell
byee
the several people are talking comes up
sometimes I get scared on this server if
heck
hopefully not
yeah
if there is more than thirty people on a server I feel threatened
of lava
into a river
I just wanna kick him
exactly
ohno
stuart little infuriates me
which involves getting water
and ill do me
well you do you
ikea makes you assemble the stuff yourself
it sure has helped me out
also do visit the geico mouth store
just cut off the thumb to even it out
aghhhh
***hEr hAnD iS miSsiNg***
***is the stump bleeding***
maybe jayne vomited
I need a code for this
it ain't broken, ***it's freaking missing***
ah
well thanks for the warning cause I don't think I could've escaped
how does one escape the stranglehold of a strawberry
wait a moment
LoVeLy
*ahem*
oh dear
just acquaintanceships
well I haven't had an in-depth relationship with a strawberry
ah
some of the sweetest fruits I've met were strawberries
only tap dancing potatoes are ones I talk to
why
here the abnormal is normal
weeg
that's just jacob I think
swearing is only acceptable if during a stuart little movie
**the tears are from laughing I swear**
**badum tsshhhh**
that guy is a creep
I suppose Nobody is better than Somebody
you've died before?
die
I probably will want to in like an hour or two
how cheery
ohdear
so it's not his fault he has killed millions on countless moons
ah
annie sounds dangerous
you seem casual about that ominous fact
that's like a fourth of their weight
weeg
I'd expect it to be proportional to body weight
weeg
quick question, how much crack does a rat have to sniff to die?
oh god
it must be wearing off
well did they get into your crack stash?
jesus christ
that's kind of worrying
famous last words
hm?
as soon as Jon comes back he has a new meme behind him
I don't know
that irrelevant but i thought of mentioning it
what the heck, i opened up and the first thing i saw was a message from me about elephants having skin hunger
i have some of my monthly averages as well
you can use the little search bar that way
so i went through every single day
you can see how many message you have sent during a specific time
believe what you want, it doesnt change the truth
statbot's time is a bit off
its not accurate as much anymore i think
i painstakingly tracked my messages every day
i didnt get my stats from statbot
e n d m e
one crazy graph of all my messages
byee
why
im disappointed in myself i didnt go that route
it would've been glorious
weeg
barry b. benson was my celebrity crush
same, but it turns out i have a lot more time to waste
sam got my notes, and i dont think he knows i included boink and no boink in it
that doesnt mean he cant kill you
indeed
he just isnt doing anything
but for sure recently sometime
i dont know today
he's been in the cafeteria before
he's been leaving us alone?

another graph
also
oh
~~you wont~~
im trying to purposefully discourage you
if you pass me in total messages on this server shelby i will hand it back to you
just if you want to maintain the 30 percent like i have
you dont need to talk more
i had something that measured percent changes every month and i dont know where it went
it is

also i made another graph because im bored, sad, and frankly dont really know what else to do
same
ha no
but im sure they exist in some form or another
i cant think of any
i dont know
life is just the end of everything you know
because then you can at least experience a form of life
no it isnt
either way im trying to communicate ending a human life is generally a bad thing
i dont think so
if we are including all variations
or top three
top five actually
maybe top ten
one of
its definitely up there though
i never said it was the worst possible things
https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/beeo1s/my_entire_dynasty_sold_into_slavery/
etc.
he has an infection
lunatic
scarred
fat
a eunuch
yeah it was cut off
he is one handed
thats his traits

https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/bej09w/please_just_die/
ck2 memes are interesting
it tends to be a pretty terrible thing
its literally the ending of their entire existence
murder is one of the worst things you could do to a person
just because your stubborn doesnt make it not true
murder is a pretty not innocent thing
you regularly talk of murder jacob
strange
it was weird
also yeah
late eyyy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6vHHxWWT0Y

ohdear
shoot
b!define foozal
what an odd idea
they certainly seem strange
I wonder who this nobody is
bye to you too, nobody
alrightyy
if anyone asks you if you are alright or they are offending you, you could just keep staring but more intensely
that would be great
I'm gonna give my legs so I can make people really uncomfortable whenever they talk about walking and running by staring at them
we do tend to found cults though
all hail peppa
indeed
A suicide bomber of the name Tyler Schiller has recently attacked a hospital while screaming "IN THE NAME OF PEPPA"
weeg
I'd start with my eyes
I should start making sacrifices
well if there are so many new peppa pig videos then I'm in a good mood
but why so many
I'm overjoyed
I never said I wasn't
my god why so many peppa pig videos
egg
this has made my day even worse
whatever will I do
I FORGOT MY PIE CHART
CRAP
I'm collecting data
four minutes and it's uno reverse cards
woah
thanks
I can't do it myself
also please kill me
there ya go
kill me
also I already told gabe and a few other people that you overdosed on benadryl
sacrifice in healthy doses
wait don't spam
***sAcRiFiCe***
*SACRIFICE*
**sacrifice**
the frog men are angry with you
did you build a temple to the frog men?
what we need more of is genetically malformed animals that are "cute"
~~genetic freak~~ *how cute*
ah
they usually go hand in hand
whatever you want
~~sounds like a terrible idea~~ sureeee?
***are the frog men in kahoots with the raccoon cats?***
the plot thickens
they must have snuck in with them
chant fiercely?
they broke in
ah
can you contact the frog men to reverse the process?
frog men are making his eyes puffy?
strange
it is Latin for "frog men"
are you sure that isn't your corpse sitting up
ah
***SHELBY***
on a scale from one to ten how likely are you to die
overdose on benadryl?
shelby, we have thoughts and then we have words
insert your mom joke here
I love random spikes of energy where I feel alive
weeg
it sounds like it
I may have permanently screwed myself up
also I have no clue how sleeping works anymore
I don't do fun
all hail
I'm fine with jim
I don't like barely any of them
yeah
I don't see the point in having it
f
wow
and a pogo stick
send help
(the more I think about it the more I should've kept this to myself)
[redacted]
is it?
I've been talking to myself for a little over ten minutes I think I actually have a problem
Wittgenstein
why
ah crap
aha
***ALL HAIL JIM***
I'm here to keep the name alive on this chat
the name jim hasn't been said since april 14th
steal your cat from abby
oh
steal your cat from yourself
goodnoot
9:15 is a bit early but alrighty
jesus approves of incest
I just did
I dont know
I got it out now
weeg
help
trying to get it put
I'm not even joking
I got my finger stuck in the barrel of a nerf gun
make it into a stew
cool
he collected one too many stamps
is that nazi
the court date is scheduled for next friday
jojo siwa has been arrested due to her alleged beating to death a disabled 67 year old woman
why is mine off by 10% you nerd
weeg
I need to make a new pie chart
the only changes will occur in lower positions maybe
the positions
I don't think there will ever be any significant changes in total messages
no clue
he is a dangerous creature
also plato is being released so be warned
I don't even want to know

but my dad really likes baseball so weeg
i probably have an actual baseball bat somewhere
along with a bat
we have the plastic crappy ones for kids
i dont
with myself
I don't know where it went
my baseball was freaking eaten by a bush
oh shoot son
***I'm trying***
I'm just trying to pray to bouse, snan, and zoom for more energy
I may
but plato is being supervised by me
God I'm so tireeeed
obviously
weeg
next 100% efficient conversion
a massive amount
turn into energy again
annihilate
not disappear
butterflies pollinate too
I mean
I wanna whack it with my cane
I swear to god this bee
woag
good luck with that endeavor
liquid crystal is definitely a drug
***science***
again
yup
science
well your dead
yay
I would rather be decapitated by the actual isis than see that picture again
I hate it so much
my god
thats your own doing
hm¿
eyyyyy
but that's different


wait a momento
that's not a punishment
weeg
I'm building a case against you
I'll take people down with me
so when its opened up
I want to fill my coffin with deadly gasses
they usually end life
I love toxic gasses
I've mentioned it but nothing's been done since then
the main reason I haven't had it changed in a while is cause I need my dad's help again
we did research on what the best mixture would be
we do need to change out the mixture of sand and stuff for his enclosure though
my sister also made a story line involving a murderous disabled girl
he was eating

I remember that
i shall
plato is seeing the outdoors once again
and the biases that may affect the evidence
learning what amount of evidence should be satisfactory
learning when to change your mind and how to properly
which is part of human rationality
i've technically read them before online
it is
they are about human rationality and how to overcome cognitive biases


im happ
I GOT MY BOOKS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
and with that I'm leaving
I'm scared

see ya
just anti-semitic
not racist
is the child dead yet
morning
*I can't tell whether I should be disgusted, confused, or happy for him for getting so far*
*I have no clue*
suffice it to say he was infertile, and didn't have an heir
*I don't think any of those things are healthy*
'The physician who performed his autopsy stated his body "did not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water."'
*yeah*
'Charles suffered ill-health throughout his life and has been described as "short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely bald before 35, always on the verge of death but repeatedly baffling Christendom by continuing to live."'
I have a nice description of him
oooh
right
that doesn't sound healthy
oh dear
my god
his jaw

the dude
ineffective ruler let say
Charles the Second was an
weeg
errr
oh
this dude must have gotten his genetics basically thrown into a blender

but
ill send pictures of them in a moment
but actually got affected by it
famous for inbreeding
much more recent
I got another family
but
anything over ten is unacceptable
I hate royal families like that
but yeah
it's fine
it's all made worse by the names
*yeah*
everything between Cleopatra the First and the Fifth is
wowieeeee
that middle portion
I have to say
weeg
you know you have a weird family when you introduce tom to your father (or grandpa depending from where you count)
but that's beside the point
and still should be fine
first cousin marriages were very normal
deformities
ya know
for most part this stuff was outlawed cause
with pharaohs it was holy to an extent
weeg
there you go
imagine the family reunions
everything is made confusing with secondary wives and incest
yeah this is simplified and what we can find from records
God ***dang***
who is the daughter of ptolemy the ninth
ptolemy the twelfth marries the daughter of ptolemy the tenth and berenice the third
cleopatra the fourth and ptolemy the ninth have a son
I don't even want to dissect that
had ***that*** generation
ptolemy the eighth married one of cleopatra's other incest baby with ptolemy the sixth
Cleopatra the second has kids with both her brothers there
arsinoe the third and ptolemy the third has a brother sister marriage
***this isn't how a family tree is supposed to look***

wait a momento
exactly
half of my knowledge is impractical
I'm not sure either
rant over
pretty darn lucky
and
so they must've been healthy
which means a little bit of inbreeding in a healthy population is a good thing
they are made more likely because the dna is more similar and they don't back up each other as well
inbreeding doesn't magically produce infertility and deformities
here is my explanation
now from what I understand
a line that inbred should've been infertile by then
historians are perplexed on how they didn't fall after one generation or two
who carried on the tradition
and they actually has kids
***brother sister marriages were common***
***do you understand how much incest happened***
it lasted around a hundred years
alexander the great and all that jazz
the one founded by greeks
one of the great mysteries of Egypt surrounds the ptolemy dynasty
talking about ancient incest
I refuse to have it interrupted
or the ghost of swift decided it was time to interrupt my incest conversation
it's increasing on frequency
it happened like two hours earlier
EVEERY NIGHT
THE SAME SONG
I SWEAR TO GOD
TAYLOR SWIFT
do you know how inbred your line will be?
jesus christ
she ran away and told me to never come near again
tried to seduce
I had a sister with 80 positive opinion of me
they have to like you a lot
cause that's hard
I'm basically only including mother/father and brother/sister
not including cousins, uncles, nephews, aunts, etc.
not once
I have never succeeded in an incestuous relationship in the game
and it actually does take skill
your welcome
good luck seducing your brother?
its annoying how many features are locked behind a pay wall
you'll need more dlc, or cheats, for this
the messalian heresy
I know a few religions that allow brother sister marriages
but
it can be
but a straight line?
like I can understand a family tree with far too many intertwined branches
goodnoot
h o w e x a c t l y
a h
the most complicated family tree you could have
affairs galore
the plague at some point
satanic cults
babies being thrown off balconies
oh yeah
most likely someone's daughter
if we are playing in africa someone is getting executed via elephant
but like none of those characters are living past 20
I'll have to check the prices tomorrow
there you go
it would be amazing though
and probably hardware
it's just prices
the learning this isn't much of a problem if we are going for chaos
again it's a paradox game
plus you all would probably find it boring
in some aspects
and I still don't completely understand it
I've sunk nearly 200 hours into the game
I watched ck2 playthroughs months before I got the game
with lots of buttons, stats, windows
paradox games tend to be in depth
oh also there is the sharp learning curve
WOOoOOoOO
MY BOOKS ARRIVE LATER TODAY
HURRAH
just everyone would need to get an overpriced game and dlc
no mods needed
it's completely possible
well
in the game running?
I heard it's a bit unstable though
and multiplayer does exist
well there is the custom ruler designer dlc
nothing beats the unpredictability of humans
if it was multiplayer and we were all playing as ourselves but as medieval rulers that would be better
weeg
but in a funny way
it would be unpredictable
especially the characters interacting with each other
and it would probably be funny
doing its own thing
so like the ai would behave as normal
many murders
so there are plots and intrigue
during medieval times
ck2 is a boring strategy game where you play as a character and then their heir once they die
and watch the brawl unfold
make the friend group rulers near to each other
if I could create multiple custom characters in ck2
you know what would be terrible
weeg
let me check
slow mode is on that one
to this server
well I'm migrating
now I won't
it was meant to sound pleasant
looks as pleasant as a warm pie on a summer afternoon
(pronounced both ways, depending on how she's feeling)
the girl named fungal
the boy named flompus
if I ever have children I shall have one boy, one girl
I'm gonna write a novel about him someday
*flompus*
you have found him
my one true love
*(the color of royalty)*
*bombastic neon yellow*
***GREENISH PURPLE***
blue
and I'm back
I'll be disappearing for a bit then
alrighty
quick 1 or 2
does that reverse the reverse or strengthen the reverse
*hunting season is coming, and this time the roles are reversed*

also
yeah
I've turned off all my notifications for haha sploosh so no

good sleep
you can have google on a phone
you have a phone fool

I found a very confusing picture when I googled "birds with tiny guns"
what
does that make us half brothers?
what he's your father too Mr. Clean?
***im scared***
he's not like I remembered
father?
down to every last digit
I need radius, diameter, circumference, area

I love being at 2%
aha my phone is almost dead
I haven't been paying attention to the time
fair enough
hm?
not only is he struggling to keep his cattle together, he is also struggling coming to terms with the nonexistence of god and the meaninglessness of life
the type of man to out gun you in a duel of bullets and wits
he's a real learn'd fellow
when he isn't living life on the range he's reading up on nihilism and god
weeg
a philosopher cowboy
you know what would be a great character
in trying
I really need to find my inner cowboy now
thats amazing
wo w
a tiny cowboy but with a big sense of importance
even if you don't have an inner cowboy
you can never have enough lassos and cowboy hats
because I'm having trouble finding mine
do we all have an inner cowboy
interesting
oh jesus
I can't move
charlotte is sprawled out across my legs
I've been immobilized
go figure
I think I'm gonna start focusing on non-fiction reading and on more sciencey stuff for a while
id let him off with a ticket instead of accidental manslaughter
yeah
reading is an acceptable excuse for everything
eyyyyyyyy
just get it
I don't know
I think you need help
that might be a problem
WHY DO MY SCIENCE BOOKS HAVE TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY STACK
ALSO FRICK
it's part of a group of organisms call extremophiles or somethin like that
it's just can survive quite a few
also it can't survive almost every situation
whatever you want to call it
water bear
tardigrade
yup
im no doctor
maybe contact an authority figure such as a guardian for advice and help
I suggest to try and get help to dampen the pain
well whomst ever this mystery person may be
ah
it's not like your dying
I wouldn't care all too much but I'd try to dampen the pain
I mean
two days sounds a bit long
well that doesn't sound healthy
how hard is the punch
death
I have warded off her spirit for now
my ipad is being possessed by taylor swift
it's happening again
I swear to god
welc
I shall
alrighty
and charlotte is snoring again
the world is a fantastic, terrible, and frankly unpredictable confusing mess so anything could be an outcome
ya never know
your welcome to read them for free if you feel like being and acting real smart
https://www.readthesequences.com
if you ever want to feel confused
but
don't worry even if you read them you wouldn't know what they were about

the first two sequence books
guess what two books I'm getting on tuesday
I'm afraid if I respond she won't ever stop
cassoways
I'm so sorry
I don't want to warrant more facts about emus
no
exactly, and obviously the best way to bond is via text
enough to be randomly texting me
probably a little
she may be partially intoxicated because this isn't normal behaviour
she's also texted me at 9:16
why

what the hecko mom
mYgOd
that one's a bit existential
all hail snozzle
***the man***
like
it's
yeah
I'm scared
what a hero
ah
now I'm going to purposely rejoin just to do that
you would think death is preferable
if I stayed I would have fallen into the dark abyss of that server and never have gotten out
good
this is why I left as soon as possible
***the chart is everything***
the chart is law
the chart is fact
how so
and thusly I'm disappearing
yup
and I'm back to wanting death
nevermind
I wish for nothing more than death
can i leave yet
thank

i do love Can Art myself quite a bit

your welcome

i Ha V E a Lo VeL i n E W ch  A a Rt
how soon
right after?
id rather not be stuck forever in the server
why would i want bleach spray
that doesnt change the fact i'd really rather not join
i'd rather throw myself from a plane
alrighty?
i feel like im dying
wow
you should be
good job on winning a glorious victory against your pet rat
why
does that take me out of the running
ah carp I missed 420
aaaaa
this is ridiculous
and his own
his saint bloodline
so now Eadwig has the custom bloodline of æthelberht
whenever someone is declared a saint a new bloodline is founded
I think The Islamic Brotherhood still exists
He's one of the first saints to be declared in the game
my god
and he was just declared a saint
one of my characters was blessed after his death by the pope, if only he knew that he founded a secret underground organisation called The Islamic Brotherhood
deserves an oscar
indeed
amazing explanation
i m p r e t t y s u r e i t s b o t h

WHOSE GONNA BE LAUGHING THEN HUH?
well im gonna die comatose in bed so HAA
and i have a club foot and am destined to live for only seven more years
my dad is also my uncle
what do you mean you dont possess many genetic maladies due to vigorous inbreeding
with many unique genetic ancestors
you freaking Outbreds
i fully think that anything barry b benson says is truth, right, and law
exactly
if everyone is cousins does that mean everything is incest
i dont know
gluten tagg
the sequences are by no mean pure
but i dont think ill like it one bit
i mean im still gonna watch episode nine

sounds like it
good for you?
anyways continue on with the planning
either way I'm not sure I'll be able to come
I'd have to talk about it with my parents
my parents are gonna be out of the house in the latter part of the day and I kinda have to make sure izzie doesn't burn the house down
those times are gonna be a bit more 'i don't know' for me
alrighty
what are the times you two are suggesting
a very interesting mystery
***im always awake***
I think I may be next
my god
and you have been killed
I'm not sure what though
I feel like I should be doing something else with my time
who knew watching some random man named mark get put on a horse could be so entertaining
a h
congratulate yourself for what kind of things
my mama and papa would not accept a horser into the family
it's past time for me
horses"
who...
"a person
"What's a horser?"
if a person says they are a horser, they are a horser"
"it's like if an actor says they're an actor, they are an actor
**papa bear always hears you**
***papa bear is coming***
*oh shoot I better scram*
I can't imagine how the normalization process would go
what if it was normal culture to call the socially dominant one of a group the papa bear
**my god**
I feel like some has already listened to it for days now
but still
fair enough
something tells me someone has already spent a lot of time breaking that record and I stand no chance
I should probably stop watching this video over and over
good luck comrade
that's up to you
imagine if that started playing over the school intercom
TAKE A GIANT LOOK AT My gIaNt PeEn
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF FRIENDS FRIENDS FRIENDS
what if I promise not to
friends friends friends
if I was apathetic enough I wouldn't care
I've gotta memorize ethans friendship song
that was said
weeg
I need to do that in the morning
this video is great for some of that stuff
w o w
I'm scared how excited ethan is getting
"sometimes the worms just fall out"
it's true
weeg
I'm pretty sure mark has talked about becoming part of the D Club before
jesus christ ethan's song
***WHAM WHAM WHAM***
*count backwards from 10*
my stomach hurts help I'm only three minutes in
KILL THE LAPTOP
okay back on track
I'm only a minute and a half in
why have they devolved so soon
what the heck
im so sorry
actually I don't think I ended up watching the dog toys one
I need to rewatch the improvs for like the seventy first time
whats upppppp myy ***crankkyyyyyyyyy boyyyyys***
god I love it
***THE BLOOD OF YOUR CHILD IS ON MY FACE***
**freaking puts ALL the eggs in**
ethan was just tired
well we've all had those days
again never have I related more to another human
"caTCH ME"
I don't think I've ever felt more connected to a human being than him during egg drop
if you aren't already on that
he's even better in the egg drop
ethan is great like that
it's terrible if you stay with the idea of it being a face
it's even worse when he cuts out a slice
I laughed so hard when it was said that it was a face
yeah
"it's leathery"
it legitimately looks like Ethan freaking cut off someone's face
his pie was actually terrifying
I love him
I know
"oH, if you don't have a filling in your pie you dont have a pie *ffffffffffffuckhole*" ethan 2k19
weeg
it's gonna happen
or core me daddy
whether it be vore me daddy
it's just natural
anytime there is something starting with "(insert letter here)ore me" someone's gonna add daddy to the end
it's a great quote though
ohdear
i forgot how great ethan was
that's acceptable
I for one would be grateful
sorry?
they are all good
that's also good
it's pretty good
I think that's his most recent makes
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6-luzdaZbng&list=PL3tRBEVW0hiDtWbfQx3THissyfLsfwT4z&index=14
his markiplier makes series is awesome
I've definitely sent it but the improv stuff is amazing as well
but jim news is classic markiplier
he'd get money from the jimolution
heck yeah
I would watch jim news everyday
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VLI_JU2G2-c
sometimes those captions are sneaky
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc93kp4UZJc
gives the head statue a quick kids before leaving
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sf-ZKCNSbWM
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTSInpYO9I
jim news?
or better yet
have you seen who killed markiplier?
there ya go
he's had quite a few bigger scale projects since then
he is king of the squirrels
yes
what few videos have you seen other than the ones I've sent
I get concerned for mark occasionally
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jHcbLgNQ4Co
stan the water man
cause of a fake man named stan
I had a conversation topic and it has slipped from my mind
ahhhh I'm getting distracted easy
**a**
***A***
insert screaming here
alrighty
well charlotte just let me lay my face next to hers until pushing on my nose with her paws
charlotte is snoring
good job
ah shooty
weeg
if travel is invented I'm using it just to add six years to my life
because you know someone at exactly age 69 is gonna die then
if only we were born earlier
weeg
probably on an equally good hour and minute
I'm planning on killing myself on 4/20/69
woag
goodnoot
I'm gonna disappear for an undetermined amount of time
yeah
leaving
blur
pain
blur
lovely silence
for me it's just blur
of course
that entrance is one of the things I remember from the blur
weeg
gus at ben's birthday party slowly picking everyone off
if he was a bit more murdery that could've been part of a horror movie
and he's just standing there waiting for us to notice him
it's freaking gus
the silhouette is instantly recognisable
a figure appears, framed against the sun on the reflection of the window
footsteps on grass
weeg
that was honestly one of the funniest entrances he's had
is that true forever now
gus we said your name, shouldn't you have materialized by now?
he makes me scared of working on the epic with him
if I lack the will power then ill lack it the rest of my life
and something is better than nothing
it's the only way I would be remembered
so why not make it as absurd as possible
and I might as well die
another statistic
if I haven't accomplished anything amazing by then I'm just another number
well I don't wanna die in a hospital room with the nurses refusing to accept my requests of blasting another one bites the dust
remind me in like ten years to kill myself via firework explosion
noice
actually the latter sounds like a pretty awesome death
I think I'm gonna listen to music so I don't yeet myself into a firework explosion
weeg
I'm gonna need a non-draining conversation within the next five hours or I'm just gonna straight up drop dead
good job being nice
F
das cool
alrighty
so we ain't doin it or what now
this is <#522534502359236609>
cause both my hands have glass in them
if your asking me I can't
I think I'll destroy a mirror in a fit of emotion
I can hardly control myself
im simply bawling with rage
im so sorry I got worked up over it
so I just went with it
I didn't think there would be much of a point to it
trying to stop you
I didn't think there was much of a point
that's true
it's been very odd arguing with it
your the one with my face as a profile picture
what has been up with you today
it's illogical spacing
it is
I'm definitely not going to do something just because you say it
either way you shouldn't be as concerned as you are about the roles
that doesn't change the fact it's a discord server
it's a discord server
because you were actually deleting messages that were okay
I'm not and we all know I wouldn't be
if you do that again ill have to actually punish you
don't delete those messages
stop abusing your power
shelby
Shelby wouldn't have ko-kaiser
I'm thinking of implementing that
then maybe you all would stop complaining
everyone should have the same role
you know what we should do
you are moderator
you do
you know what we should do
we've been over this before
it's an honorary title
she created the server
why do you all want your own role
she doesn't
eyyyyy
while you still can
im so, so sorry
i can do 11
im able to go
weeg
it is cat
they close early on sundays so we would have to move the time we go and leave quite a bit
"3/10 not enough incest."
***the creativity of the ck2 player base always manages to come up with wonders***
https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/56kjs2/ck2_the_only_game_where_you_can_play_as_an/
also
weeg
so im down for a demon child ruling my fresh kingdom
apparently he'll just get insane stats
i should probably read more on that event so i can get a bit prepared for my anti-christ son to go to war against the whole world
either way my playthrough is gonna get a lot more interesting
fair enough
like its an actual thing i've read about
i do know the anti-christ event is
but i dont know if that event is in the game
im hoping for that
exactly
what would you do
well if your son killed a snake with his bare hands, drank poison and survived, and then had visions that he will become a god all before the age of ten
only naturally i named him my heir
and i feel like ten years down the line that my anti-christ baby is gonna cause a lot of trouble
anyways i was *trying* to convey that a lot has been happening in my game all of a sudden
im talking logical spacing
thats not an actual reason
your spacing just to do it
its illogical spacing that makes no sense
and you may be blamed
you all know the difference between spam and not spam
and no it was actual words that werent illogically spaced out
also thanks for ruining the flow
no?
also also also also also my brother is ruling in the holy land cause of a crusade
also also also also im secretly a sunni and i started a small underground religious organisation called the islamic brotherhood
also also also i am building a monument to wiglaf
also also i became an official king
this is a sad day
also the incest baby died in a coma
weeg
once he invited me and my sister on and that was cool
being on one of those police boats its actually pretty nice
which is why he was on the news for five seconds
and doing other boaty stuff
my dad has been gone the whole day cause he is on the river escorting a fireworks barge
thunder over louisville and everything
thats just the planes
what blew up
hm?
he is six years old
im scared
eadwig has had a vision from god saying that he'll become god
he is actually the anti-christ
also eadwig just freaking drank poison and is okay
no not exactly
i actually think so
he strangled a snake to death in his crib and has an ominous glint in his eyes constantly
i think my son is the anti-christ
i have
help i accidentally founded a radical islamic terrorist organisation
try drugs
i dont know how to properly utilize that information though maybe you could
even if its small
its scientifically proven that doing a new thing each day make the week feel longer instead of it being a blur of normality
yeah i dont even know how that happened
thats not a very good point
your point is?
and slightly annoying
she is obsessive
my sister waited an hour and a half for him to be on the news for like five seconds
momentarily
oh my dads on the news
you cant win everything
shoot
except my son is dumb and left handed
meanwhile im slaughtering infidels in the middle east
all is okay with the world
this is magical
he is to the friseal dynasty who i have been marrying into for those three generations prolifically
IT ONLY TOOK THREE GENERATIONS
HAHA
THE FIRST INBRED CHILD HAS APPEARED
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
deus vult
right
that part is your own twisted and dark imagination jabob
wow really you dont say
yeah
interesting
King Davins II 'the Moaner' of Livonia
the current king of livonia is a direct descendent
he sacrificed one of his sons to the gods
***he's murdered 20 people***
***twenty kills***
King Davins I 'the World Burner' of Livonia has
my god
he would still drown
so no
he only got als in his twentys
who says he didn't know how to swim
ignorance is strength
im sure that has saved plenty of people from diseases
i've definitely seen that before
w h a t
right
sure
alright
so many many reasons
oh jesus why
gluten tagg
no
i watched lil' johnny get sucked under a lawn mower and never return
ah im getting distracted
you underestimate him
he'll do it either way
be careful if you do get it
weeg
they are the one who plot
what's not cool about that
ambition
cunning
dude
slytherin is an amazing house
no it doesn't
good job
huffley puff it is then
and 19% huffley puff
22% gryffindor
26% slytherin
I'm 33% ravenclaw
also oddly enough according to the extended sorting hat quiz
interesting
woaf
if you want those record take them
just go with something
dude
that's what I did
then your stupid
no
it's the dragon pox fool
it is very valuable
the answer to me was a bit obvious
jesus pepperoni
eyyyyyyyy
all is right with the world
I took the full quiz with all the questions and I got ravenclaw
you cheater
what the actual heck
I got gryffindor again
I got gryffindor
the sorting hat is on crack
what the frick
that's what varies my house between slytherin and ravenclaw
what changes however are the questions
my answers tend to stay the same
what's that supposed to mean
I got slytherin
also eyyyyyy
yeah
but I'm prepared for all possibilities
I know
I will however never let it go if you somehow get slytherin
no one, not even the test can convince me otherwise now
once a hufflepuff always a hufflepuff
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/8t3y39/i_created_exact_replicas_of_pottermores_sorting/&ved=2ahUKEwjCwK_Zqs3hAhVNKqwKHVbrA1cQjjgwAHoECAQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3oEOol8N--xhU6zCkc419y
if you ever need retaking
if you are taking the actual pottermore quiz
well the questions are randomized
has it?
that also means I can steal
*sounds like a parenting mistake*
sounds like a parenting mistake
if one of them is a ravenclaw can I steal them?
~~that's a very minor detail that can be overlooked~~
**my god**
how many hours each day?
how long will you be doing this research?
well good luck I guess
alright
this is a serious commitment you are making shelby
are you prepared for such a rigorous endeavour?
you may have to live as a rat for a few years to fully understand
this could take months
you need to dive deep into their minds
so deep you can do the test for them
you need to sort them first
well
oh jesus
also 15 million to gryffindor for the doggo that learned these tricks
fair enough
ten million points to ravenclaw for bringing this amazing video to the internet

THIS IS A LIFE CHANGING EVENT
BE MORE EXCITED THAN THAT
that I can accept
there ya go
that was a lot more boring than I expected
ever heard of that saying
"better late than never"
there's plenty of point
well why aren't you sure
I expected much fanfare for my glorious presence but I guess not
after accidentally falling asleep for three hours I'm alive once again
woag
alrighty
i only died momentarily
woag indeed
aha im alive once more
sounds like a lovely pastime to indulge in
also my sister is being dropped off like half an hour after six
alrighty
noice
maybe they need motivation
its the least you could do gus
tell them to make it quick
203 west utica street
o h d e a r
impressive but also ohno
alrighty
a sad picture of poor perby

also perby is here
this is like a ray of hope among the crumbling ruins of our school system
this is what should be taught in classrooms
instant pay increase
i would be proud if i was assessing that teacher
**ominous beats on a drum intensifies**
the most amazing thing i've read in a while
that is
w ow
w o w
it would be helpful if you guys could take me
we do people have to have guns
they found a car with bullet holes in it so that may delay him quite a bit
also i think my dad definitely wont be able to pick me up
quite a string of labels there
my aunts mothers daughter
i mean sometimes that stuff just hides
yeah
always works for me at least
weeg
just look inside
its always a useful trick when you cant find what your looking for
there may be cats
did you look inside the rabbits
come one come all for the number one attraction of the hour
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
also
wait a momento im making perby
perby going around calling people governor and offering shoe shines for a pence
i know
perby would do great as one of the impoverished orphan boys living in victorian era london
**perby** needs to eat tonight
Perby sounds like the name some orphan off the street gave to themself
*mayhaps*
possibly
really he doesnt know
my dad might still be able to
weeg
if it comes to that
that could work
my dad is supposed to take me but some ideosos decided a drive by shooting would be a good idea
i might be late quite a bit to your borthday
<@!249334432689815552>
fair enough
remember kids you cant be racist against your own race
*byeee*
*I think that's a good place to leave off at*
*yeah*
***until they migrate***
not face knees
your knees are leg knees though
ohno
and every once in a while they try to move
I thought it would be like a part of the sides of the face
im scared now

I don't even want to know what that looks like
what an unfortunate last name
bilshwack
bye
thats lovely
alrighty

bye
im in prison
minor set back
gluten tagg
I'm going to run into it screaming incoherently about bombs while holding tad in a hoodie above my head, randomly bashing people with him and throwing him
alright
that's a really good idea
possibly a crumpled up piece paper
so I'm going to threaten to bomb them instead once I walk in
alrighty so it turns out getting a bomb is hard
so im onto bombing the bank
turns out I don't have to incite racial violence
so im on step two
alrighty
stop immediately and reconsider
try harder
making the studying all the more effective
I forgot to study again
I'll do it tomorrow
FRICKKK
FRICK
ha frick
I'm gonna put it off to play minesweeper for a few hours till I get kicked out
live in my forest
run to canada
steal my knees
bomb the bank
distract the police by inciting racial violence between the black minorities and them
new plan
also yeah that's true
canada doesn't have police
first of all
how would it?
live in my forest
run to canada
steal the knees
bomb the bank
new plan
that's true
reattach them
slide them back in
just pop them back in
well I'll get my knees back during the heist
live in my forest
run to canada
heist
okay new plan
I gotta steal my knees back
god dang banks
especially with no knees
okay turns out it's a lot harder than I thought
weeg
I'm thinking of hitchhiking then illegally crossing the border so I can get to the piece of land that I purchased
goodnoot
***I couldn't find anyone willing to take the money for the job so I spent it on buying a small patch of forest in canada***
***I needed to purchase exactly fifteen golden statues of geese with fifteen dead geese in each***
***im at a public library at this moment***
***ive lost absolutely everything***
***you don't understand***
***i took out a massive loan and put up my knees as part of my collateral***
***i lost my liquid and physical financial assets along with the knees***
***not anymore***
***i cant***
***my legs are just straight***
MY KNEES CAN'T BEND ANYMORE THOUGH

weeg
*"Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking."*
what were you talking about
***how dare you insinuate anything different than rob lowe***
it happens
being a religious symbol to billions and all
its a tough business
its just what you do
rob lowe supports jesus
jesus supports the fact you hung a random lady in illinois during the summer of '76
well if your making sacrifices and lighting candles you might as well throw jesus in there

goodnoog
if the arch was in illinois then it would be famous for something
it was to missouri ben
das ist true with many exceptions
what the heck is it famous for?
what proof do we have of illinois?
i mean
that makes sense
illinois being said too many times for a discord server between friends, circa. 1976 illinois
you being hung for being a terrible person, circa. now you blind buffoon
abe lincoln being hung for excessive cocaine usage, circa. 1830 illinois
some n***eeeeEEEEERRRRDDDDd***, circa. 1976 illinois
also i cant believe her last name is bloome
vanessa bloome being hung for *beestiality*, circa. 1976 illinois
illinois
the president, who was mistaken for a 9 year old wanted murderer, being hung, circa. 1976 illinois
twenty four pairs of random innocent pants being hung for drying, circa. 1976 illinois
a random innocent glue bottle being hung for witchcraft, circa. 1976 illinois
sure
a random innocent woman being hung for witchcraft, circa. 1976 illinois
are you happy now with kaiser still in my name
you just have a low opinion of me

did you count how many cars came by before it was your parent's
well you are, presumably, alive
but was the burnt hand warm?
that sounds problematic
of course

well guess what
if you want I could delete some of my messages
sorry, and my words above do not reflect my actual beliefs
anyways I'll stop talking and sorry jabob
also sorry again but I'm going to betray you again because shelby n has infected me with her terrible thinking
wow
that's
wow
Cool Aids, Man?
just that other people may think that easily
plus I never said you were
no need to curse though
sorry
yeah you are a bit blind for not seeing that
¿
nope?
okay you're off the hook
there ya go
same with sam
also gus they nearly never deny it for some reason
byee
and you always come in at the wrong times
because everything devolves
it's jokey jokes
no need to get defensive
it's called teasing
eyyyyy
<@523942081870430210> you still there?
I'm genuinely concerned
like I'm being serious if you are right now
but what did we do wrong this time
I mean my comment could be mean if you look at it the right way
what did we do?
hard to think she could devolve anymore
but nein
I can understand that
you and shelby n were who I was talking about
you two could be a think tank of just weird and terrible ideas
yeah there you go
how unfortunate
only the worst of people
ill answer my own question
who would murder hair?
as you should be
bye
who doesn't like some tentacles
ah
I once dreamt of being high
want some weed?
only the most illegal of activities sirs
and I'm good at scamming high profile individuals but you don't hear me bragging about it
what the heck is a polynomial
yes
i have something for you to read now
you've read harry pooter right?
im going to skin you alive i swear to god
c o m e a l i v e
<@!249334432689815552>
BEN
I REMEMBER WHAT I WAS DOING
OH
thats misframing it
you are greedy
i tried my best
is that okay
wait a momento
i forgot what i was doing now
ill take that as a yes
is that okay?
why do you think that
oh
IM ALIVE AGAIN
furry
that makes so much sense
my god i never realized that
basically
yeah pretty much
with honor
i think ill just murder people in a 18th century fashion
that doesnt sound fun at all
fair enough
help im bored
not only is my dad apparently magical, he is also completely bonkers
the reds won the game
that was yesterday
my dad made a "sacrifice" to a voodoo statue so the reds would win a game
eyyyyy
gluten tagg
yup
its really quite disconcerting each time and i'd appreciate it if i was told how to fix it
does anyone know why a fake version of willy wonka occasionally appears in my brain to argue with me?
thats how you know someone is serious
I demand to have the best of both worlds
im just amazing in that way
so ha
also I did do it
byeee
I've been juggling it with this conversation
also I just realized I forgot to finish the water paper
take on the world in the most violent way possible apparently
weeg
less soaked in blood
let's say
most of our interests are just less
we all have something we are passionate about
well
all by himself?
not again
ohno
edgy
a h
right
that's absurd
what kind of conversations are you prepared for?
you didn't miss much
no one else was on
he moved no more
in one movement manny fell to the ground, and covered his shame as the condom filled with diet coke, then frozen bludgeoned him for a 23rd time
*Et tu, Greg?*
his eyes fell upon his beloved greg, with fury in his eyes as he wielded a condom filled with diet coke, then frozen over his head
after being bludgeoned an estimated 22 times, he lifted his face to see his next attacker
all manny had to fight back with was half a mechanical pencil
he was also the one who procured the weapon they all used: a condom filled with diet coke, then frozen
however, greg wasn't the leader of the conspiracy, that dubious honor would fall on the shoulders of a much less known rodrick
some speculate that greg was actually adopted and raised by manny as his son
greg was the son of one of manny's favorite mistress, susan, making his betrayal all the more infamous
one of these most famous conspirators was greg
also like his role model he would find himself dead, murdered by a group of conspirators devoted to keeping the republic at any costs, sprawled on the senate floor on the ides of march
manny heffley has been elected president, and in his first hundred days in office he has managed to bypass congress, hold complete control over the constitution, seize power for himself and proclaimed him to be president for life, also proclaiming himself the human incarnation of the god Jupiter, all while maintaining popular support much akin to his role model caesar

he is doing something, although i doubt it is purposeful and it usually ends in a bad
oh he is doing something
what the heck are you guys talking about
im aware of this and thats why i wouldnt give you it
"Do you not trust me in power I got no clue how to use the power so it is not like I can do anything with it"
it was more so reasons for you not to get it
you just said you wouldnt want it jabob
i wouldnt do that
but no
you are making it sound like you want me to
im bored again
bye
that makes a bit more sense
alrighty
i seriously doubt you have as much to hide as you are acting like
i could've lied about the audit log not showing the messages themselves
well now you just made me curious
oh thank god?
i can see whether you deleted a message but i cant see what the message was
that stuff
message deletions
just like people joining
it doesnt record messages
the log of actions that happen on discord
yay
also you are just stubborn jabob
people tend to dislike something if they feel forced or worse was bugged to do it
if you only care for me to do the thing, but that has nothing to do with how i feel doing it
thats a terrible strategy
then make them
that could work
bug them
nemo and gus are technically online
well i was gonna leave anyways
ill take that as a hint and leave
exactly
also i'd like to hear the strategy, if you are still online
i usually am however
but actually bye
but its kinda funny
i have no clue who he was and if he got caught up in something then thats a bit unfortunate
ill be gone to probably regret my decisions
anyways i wasted too long of my life on a crappy-not-funny not-april-fools april fools joke
no
im not arguing any further
indeed you do
so your not getting it
otherwise its a stupid addition
its only useful if you have power
yeah
so why do you want it?
it does nothing
yup
audit log is for moderators
please stop your begging
nor are you getting an audit log
dude its an insignificant role i dont give a crap about it
you offered that in exchange for me joining
no
thats intended
can thou delete the messages again
is everything fine now?
i did that
weeg
sure but i probably need to give back powers wait a momento
anyways nothing that eventful will probably ever happen so you should've enjoyed the confusion while you had the chance
indeed
thats what im doing fool
im not bad im ingenious
which makes it all the more effective
and
insanity and boredom
I SURE AM
SO HOW ARE YOU ALL LIKING THIS

**ill break ye fins**
ill break ye fins
you should be sorry
your nemo yeah i noticed
and one of those is a lot more likely than the other
either im a comedic genius who somehow managed to make the most basic of terrible puns funny, or you, shelby, have a problem
im scared and im not entirely sure what that means
vigorously exhaled*
exhaled*
that is a very odd way of describing it
my god did you really?
oh deer

i have a stranglehold on my position
weeg
im at 36k boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

the internet is such an odd place full of wonders to be seen

NEW PIE CHART YALL
**fungal husband**
hm?
but i didnt invite him for obvious reasons
there was actually a currency bot i looked at that had the feature of marrying other members of the server
why exactly?
gay emu
E X A C T L Y R I G H T
guys guess my gender
exactly

but nina tucker memes are amazing
i need to rewatch it

nina
what was her freakin name
its legitimately a good show
ahoy mateys i am here to plunder thee
thats odd
and less obvious
shouldn't be more faint
isn't dramatic music usually bad background music
also this minecraft music I have for the background as I type is awesome
I'm lucky I'm not you cause I'd rather not be able to imagine it
I literally can't imagine a Me but with Sam's personality
***suicide***
**suicide**
even if it is only when he's depressed
but he is at least capable of intelligent conversation
yeah pretty much
and sam on the other
with me on one end
it isn't like there is a Spectrum of Personality™
why was a more sam like me the first thing to pop up
I was about to say
I'll certainly try
or at least the good parts of you
please don't change
yeah
you at universal studios would be like a kid in a candy shop, wouldn't it?
god
indeed you can
we'll see how far you get
it's what makes it memorable
road trips like this kinda are just usually chaotic
I mean
it will
I can find joy in the hardships of it
it'll be fun
we were never good at planning
I mean
we'll make it up as we go
neither do I
can the road trip happen yet?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
im more than aware
which is constant bamboozling
I simply do what's right
I'm no hero
I'm just doing my job
your welcome fine citizen
*great bamboozler*
you have been bamboozled by *the*
and more so
and yet you are
the Great Bamboozler
it tis i
weeg
so ha
I'm just listening to something else
I never said I would sleep
I won't listen to the soundtrack
fine
cause harry potter is here now
I don't want to
BUT HARRY POTTER IS HERE NOW
BUT HARRY POTTER IS MORE IMPORTANT
I KNOW THAT
meanwhile I'm going to go through each one of these 174 songs
that makes sense
to go over the entire harry potter soundtrack
you know what is a good idea
help
why
it's not even funny
why is it hurting me not to laugh
another oxiclean comercial
they go for the gut
they don't dawdle
"was expecting an april fools but instead I got an april feels"
probably not
I think I have an irrational love for the bittersweet
peasant
aha
if not all of them
I predict it will survive many purges
certainly a worthy addition to my playlist
weeg
shush
I don't care about your diabetes lady
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VG5uO6B1S3E
so I can conduct another purge
i've just been trying to add more content to my playlist
I know
"how to remove blood stains with oxiclean"
and the first thing that popped up was
I just got an advert
wait a moment
actually
I'll find it again
just listen to something
it's a good type of dying on the inside that has become far too routine
aha I'm back and only dying a little bit
wait a momento
AW CRAP I FORGOT TO DO SOMETHING I PROMISED MYSELF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY
ahhhHhHhhHHHHH
ahhhh
ah
congrats
short attention span?
it's fine
oh alrighty
what's the date the minecraft realm is gonna be up and about
it is
AND SOON ILL BE TOO
IT'S DEAD NOW
I GOT SO CAUGHT UP WITH COOLMATH GAMES THAT I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY IPAD
I'M AN IDIOT
I WANT TO DIE
NOOOOOOOOOOO
I love it
weeg
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oQTx6s7sifU
ISORROWPRODUCTIONS ACTUALLY DID A COOLMATH GAMES SUBSCRIBER SPECIAL
YESSSSSS
YRS
they are only mildly impossible
if I had a time machine you wouldn't believe how much id abuse it
can't the weekend last a day more for Glitterhoof?
now I really don't want school
I think ill have glitterhoof educate my children, if he's still alive
I'm also looking into loopholes to get horse people
indeed
got it
and always go for the paranoid trait
they have the potential of developing the lunatic trait
send you children into hiding at an early age
aha
"marry your cousins more"
I googled it
makes the game less fun
nah I won't
I could cheat
indeed
the statue that took five hundred years to build
maybe I'll just have to wait every hundred years or so for construction
I dunno
but then they would instantly win and release me
if I don't die in battle
I could go to war and get captured
but I can't see it working
that's along the lines of what I'm thinking
I don't know how I'd do that though
one of the ways someone can go insane is torture
god I wish there was genetic mental illness in ck2
so I'll have to literally drive him insane
the only way I can get him to make him gain the lunatic trait
I know
his son refuses to spend the next decade on the monument to glitterhoof
but I'm very angry
most of it is
inbred children die fast
and ill sweep up the easy pickings
realm destabilized
and their line is dead
that a few more generations of this
but I'm hoping
he just married cousins and all that jazz
I say vigorous but it really wasn't that bad
oh also he tried to destabilize the future offspring of a very powerful scottish kingdom through vigorous inbreeding
indeed
it was natural
it was peaceful though
sad he had to die
indeed
and had one more child before passing
so he married the strange tunnel peasant lady
then she died of cancer
realized he made a mistake
proceeded to torture her
Wiglaf imprisoned his first wife
before they were married
they had three children
but that's no matter
I suspect she was lying
well this peasant woman managed to weasel her way into nobility
in hindsight Wiglaf was absolutely manipulated there
actually
and next thing a 69 year old Wiglaf knew he was watching her undress in his study
but he let her stay
he did contemplate executing her
it wasn't quite love at first sight
while patrolling these they came across a young woman in her 20s who looked rather gaunt, and couldn't stop rambling
while they were in seclusion in the castle during an epidemic they inspected avenues of escape via secret passages under the castle
in a very peculiar situation
then he met his soon to be next wife
the next four were his and his wife's
along with his entire family
who Wiglaf proceeded to murder
and the third one was from an affair his wife has with a count
he had two with some random lady who ended up dying at 29
his first three weren't even technically of the dynasty
honestly most of his children have their own tale to tell
nothing came of her and she died of the flu at 25 in eastern europe
probably because he legitimately thought that she was the child he had with the bush
he of course adopted her and treated her as his
strangely enough a day later he happened to find a newborn child in that bush
bleeding, and a bit miffed about the whole ordeal
in that same bush
but alas, all that happened was him waking up an hour later
he ran straight into a thorny rose bush in an attempt to pursue her
in another fit of lunacy Wiglaf thought he saw a beautiful dryad
yes that's right
three, if you count a bush
he had two lovers
but despite his ugliness he still had a charm with the fairer gender
and that's even before his face was cut off to cure his cancer
he did have a severe case of dwarfism, and he did look a bit disfigured
they weren't wrong
Wiglaf the Hideous
people gave him such nicknames as:
indeed his exploits were told across the land for centuries to come
***glitterhoof***
in honor of his chancellor
he would've built a massive, towering statue of a horse
and if he didn't die so soon
he founded the Kingdom of Essex
he founded the Great and Noble House of Splooge
but a great one
he was a bit of a mad man
who lived in England a thousand years ago
there was once a man named Wiglaf
while your thinking let me tell you a tale of lunacy
fair enough
not such a comedic genius after all?
well let's see it then
personally I thought it more as the peak
one of a kind
**badum tshhh**
you should stop though
usually
you should really stop doing that
if I try things tend to go my way
I have full confidence in myself
but things won't backfire
I wish
and ill be golden
I'm going to ask me parents to check on me with that so I kind of force myself into that routine
just not the motivation
which I definitely have the time for
I'm also planning on staying a step ahead of the curriculum
that's what I'm planning
but I can adapt
the leap from middle school to high school will be a bit hard
I'll have to adapt to a rapidly changing classroom
oh it will
I've mastered the art of listening without paying attention
one of the reasons I tune out a bunch
it's infuriating
the small inaccurate things
maybe pay attention this week and see if I snap
I should do something this time
another day of sludge through school
april 8th
woop
I drank all of it
too late
i might as well start anew
everyday I'm disappointed more by this server
when did you get that profile picture
I don't see the difference
you don't know that
thou cannot speaketh
also I know pastafarianism better than thee
that's lovely
which is in part why I'm bored
I'm brimming with energy
I'm not tired though
I'M SO BOREDDDD
end me
right
those are faces
yes
founder of the house of splooge
first king of essex
Wiglaf
I love this man
this is a magical year of his life which I shall treasure
and he's still having children
also my character lived to 69 years
you confuse me more than anything else jabob
hell is so odd
exactly fear me
haha im alive again peasants
anyways im gonna disappear
nope
sure
i need to make a new pie chart
i will forever be in the lead
lovely
interesting
noice
ooh
sure
cRaCk cOcAiNe oN mArS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmZ1UPGlhoE
that makes more sense
oh
i hand it over for a minute and you manage to break it?
h o w
http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js/
ah
hm?
exactly
right click on me and see how well it goes
try

my
on
cup
a
with
typing
am
i
haha
he shall have to die
no
im doing it for the greater good
i shall step on him
indeed
bam problem solved
ill become close to him then murder him
i can sure frickity frackiting try
oh that makes everything a lot more easier if i can just flatter him
thats sounds problematic
a h
may i ask what is up with the freaking deformed bug to the side
ah
is that a fact?
it is extremely
so instead of "things" like how you would expect its "hings" like how he actually pronounces it
they help a little bit, but the problem is they try to closely mimic what he is saying
you may need captions starting out
i've watched him enough to where i can usually make out what he is saying now
hes amazing
too long for someone like dee dee
indeed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22KiKYflVew
exactly
ill do it later
i give up
i've watched each movie like five times
hence why i can reference it and understand references
i already have
maybe ill try in five minutes
i need to try again
its painful
i've tried
i need to read lord of the rings
exactly
its canon now guys
but also im pretty sure he did
stepped on by a webhook
byeth
of course you did
no i didnt
*excessive drug use*
that may be fun but i think that could be made ten times as good with a little something called
bOriNG
what are you expecting if you give us it
we are probably gonna end up accidentally killing ourselves even without the alcohol
which is the only two acceptable ways to end a party
either we are gonna get arrested or someone is gonna kill themselves
i'll bring some weed
***yesss***
will alcohol be made available?
one last question
that sounds good
its fine
because i dont want to have to wait like 12 hours for sea shanty 2 to show up
how long will this funeral party be taking place
wait a moment
truly only the best and most fitting music for a time of mourning
its not legal, in more ways than one
her belongings will be laid out on a table and anyone could take stuff
weeg
you'll miss out on stealing some of her stuff
im assuming this isnt it a proper open casket place and we are kind of hosting it illegally in some random empty warehouse
oh alrighty that sounds fine
have you thought about the financial part?
can you even afford the funeral?
indeed
did you fix the fact i signed it like thirty times?
good
dash
quick
fast
run
you should be
yeah
you act like the straightest person i know jabob
i'll repeat this a second time
predictable but still ridiculous nonetheless
honestly you two this is ridiculous
the Great Noble Act of Handing Over a Calculator™
yeah it's been a pretty long time considering debts
weeg
**it should be involuntary**
you heretic
you only say aww after she does
cat

also
I can tell
I doubt it but maybe
and I don't remember
which is why I'm scared as to why I played for 8 straight hours
with every other game I can't do that
weeg
i can only really do that with minecraft funnily enough
its hard for me to get in such a flow state
i dont think i'd be able to manage that
help
i dont remember this
"play on the same map and server for 8 hours"
i looked at the last achievement i got for  garry's mod and its called "marathon"
im scared
exactly
indweed
they are different you know
no I meant indeed
indeed
you know my father was a frickity frock hawk
how dare you call me a frickity frock hawk
really they are the same thing
or just restarting the computer
steam wont open so that means im ending my life
may you burn for stealing this from me
frick
11:11 fools
what a time to be alive
im alive for both
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
shhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHH
i may do that later
i would actually do research into the circles of hell so i could make them suit this server's own needs
depends on what you call a circle of hell
it would be great
so we would have like the circles and everything as different channels
if i was actually the creator of this server i would model it after hell
the only reason i'm in hell is because i couldnt have cancer
you have no proof i do such things
i dont tell lies
i need to play runescape "real quickie"
indweed you shall have
indweed
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do, and I full support your decision
yeah but what's the point when you have an irrational disliking towards it
continue
I'm not playing minecraft anymore
oh look at that
why might you have to
cause I'm confused
no one is forcing you to?
that's only counting the famous ones that are dead
usually you can find some rally of people celebrating cause they believe they are burning in hell now like they deserve
especially when I prominent athiest dies
you can see this affect all around the world
because they are dehumanized
if a nonbeliever is simply someone condemned to eternal torture then it becomes easier to commit appalling acts toward them
it's called dehumanization
people do
im aware
if it was real it would be worse is what I'm saying
but it still has the affect of dehumanizing people
thats the only way hell isn't worse
in literally every way
hell is much worse than cancer
your parents need a lobotomy
but it twas a good book jabob
I know
but I was busy with a book
yeah probably
otherwise I would've
I can't really say anything cause I wasn't there to see the movie though
I am too
you all are clearly geniuses
why do you ask
SO MANY wrong things
so
so
may humanity die in the next 150 years
may the jelsa fandom melt
so ha
I only make vague tolkien references
but I'm not
if I was even more of a nerd I would name the exact characters
but it's a real elvish human sorta thing
and I hope it burns
I hate it
ill have to start vigorously swallowing bandaids
I just ripped an intestine
ow
***terrible jokes***
*terrible*
terrible
purely because I'm not trained to see those kind of
that took me a few moments to get
the first time 'stick' was said on this server was when I was quoting a hitler speech
but quick comment
oh nice
nevermind
"I NEED AN AMPUTATION SAW AND A STICK TO BITE DOWN ON"
the first instance of stick chronologically I think
what other key word would be interesting
I was properly tired
I distinctly remember that now
***D U N G B E E T L E***
***HE IS CLEARLY A TRIPLE STRIPED SILVER BACKED SILK WORM***
***WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT MY FATHER***
***how dare you***
I have one response
I'm laughing pretty bad too
I need some air in my lungs after that
wow
just me saying I have tourettes
the freaking screenshot you took
I'm dYing
I was
and yes
it was at 2:30 specifically
even mean
*laughs in mexican*
plus what does
it makes me sound stupid
*yeah...*

for example I can just search up every instance of the word
I love the search function
it's really easy to navigate through the history

also I just realized something back up in the messages
you've been with them nearly all year
*exactly*
***we have a winner***
***ding ding ding***
"shelby lomax"
to which someone said out loud
and he responded with no one
I never mentioned it but mrs. walters asked sam who his celebrity crush was before we moved the desks for the socratic circle
you should've seen how red sam's face was when we were teasing him one time in coding
honestly I can see why she does it
I don't place any blame on her
hey, she saw something and she went for it
I'm just messing with you
it isn't
~~let's be honest no one would know you'd be under a love potion of it was you and sam~~
but oh the teasing
sure there would be sympathy if we ended up being victims as well
well let's be honest we are all going to make fun of you for the rest of your life for that
so you guys would be fine after maybe a week to month of trauma
the thing with love potions is that they wear off and they obviously only induce intense infatuation not real love
you would also fall
yeah
gus and jacob are naturally paranoid so they would be harder to get
ben would also likely fall
sam would be the first victim
you can figure it out on your own
the rest of you
if she thinks she can outsmart me she is terribly wrong
and I'd go to similar lengths to protect myself
if you get spiked you deserve it
you'd have to be a bit of a dumb dumb to not check your food and drink for that stuff
honestly
I wouldn't
she'd spike freaking everyone's drink
that's what I was originally thinking of
nothing that the infirmary can't fix anyways
she should be mostly harmless
but as long as she isn't too powerful and is weak
she would be the one to fear the most
weeg
or angry
I'd just mess with people when I get bored
I wouldn't be dangerous with magic
I know
weeg
I'd be able to wreak havoc like I always dreamed of doing
could you imagine the friend group at hogwarts?
why it is very important
it's alright
really don't look ahead in any shape or form
please though
DON'T DO THAT OR I'LL BE FORCED TO WIPE YOUR MEMORY
SHELBY
definitely not
that's why I didn't mention hpmor earlier
I forgot your brain was mush
I understand
hpmor.com
starting with a day of very low probability and ending with fundamental attribution error
you can read the first five chapters
in order to give you a hint of what's to come
I've come to a decision
so basically someone I'd marry on the spot
alternate harry is like me, but smarter and more slytherin
if I was introduced to the wizarding world of course I'd conduct experiments and attempt to figure out the mysteries of magic
I mean
I can relate to him I just can't with other characters
oh also I like it a bit just cause of alternate harry
alrighty
the only reason I haven't forced you is any potential spoilers for the actual series
I'm skimming through the chapters for a momento
and that's *why I* ***love it***
because I have
so I think it's completely excusable to be rendered an idiot by it
if you get what I mean
most of the hpmor stuff I can grasp but I don't know
and I don't think this'll change my mind
I'm smart enough to understand that
I legitimately think you are smart, but it's just that I'm smarter
no no no
after every chapter I'm planning to go over it with you
this im **real** passionate about
oh don't worry
which I can't tell whether that'll end up being fine, problematic, or good
I mean you don't even know any of the science behind the stuff harry is saying
you'll be going into it completely blind
plus
but amazing
it's real mind twisty
all 122 chapters
you know what ill force you to read then afterwards, right?
with the slightly selfish motivation of wanting to gush about the series
what I really want is to have an in person, face to face conversation about it with the books in front of us
just that it is read eventually
honestly I don't care much at which pace you read it
I really don't think I will read something like it again
something that really is truly special
and anyone who dismisses it is missing out on something spectacular
it's one of the best, most modern, literary masterpieces
dislike it without having read it
or even worst
it's why I flip out when I hear people haven't read it
yeah
plus there is the extra layer of the most realistic and amazing characters and friendships I've ever read
over the course of years
gotten to know them better and better
and it hits so much harder when you have gotten attached to them
dying
they read them laughing, living, crying
they literally grew up with these characters
that's why so many people are so devoted to harry potter
it's really quite genius
you are gonna see more and more of these themes show themselves as you read on
but also in characters, lore, world building, the moral grey area
not only in vocab and sentence structure
and more complicated
as they go one they get longer
and so naturally jk rowling wrote the books catering to that age
so if you were, say the same age as harry you were the same age next year as well
and the next, a year later
the first book was published in 1997
the reason the earlier books are so black and white is because the books are all written with a growing audience in mind
you're gonna like the rest of the books
it has to be the most inhumane prison I've ever heard dreamt up of
personally I was abhorred to learn that if you commit a crime worse enough you were to be literally tortured every day in that prison for as long as your sentence
it was a very spoopy book considering the last two
well talking about azkaban surely you must have thoughts on the prison itself
any comments or will I have to force out discussion
you're three books in
anyways
well at least you want to
seek a mental evaluation
things
leprechaun
I can't tell if I'm weird for not having the same reaction or your weird for having this reaction to
personally I think you trying to explain it is more funny than the actual thing
I must be too much in a harry potter mindset right now cause now I'm just confused and concerned
I guess I can see why that would be funny
you find the oddest things in harry potter funny
the bulgarians and the who evers they are playing against
oh yes indeed
how far are you into harry potter
weeg
nerds
except the people who don't have free accounts
gronstle shall become a powerful wizard feared by all
I shall try that next time
that's pretty much all
oh I found a patch of unlimited cabbages and I played the organ
cause I can't cook
nothing but four full burnt chicken corpses
so I killed them for nothing
I was trying to play as an unlawful citizen but there was no repercussions for my actions
and now I'm solving the murder of some random sister there
come across a temple
wander off back into the desert
kill some spiders
come across a town
get lost for a bit
wander into the desert
collect bones
cook chicken
steal eggs
slaughter chicken
succeed to kill those two women
fail two pick pocket two women
ignore the beginners quest
teleport to a town
all I did during my hour of play was skip the tutorials
same
splooge was already taken
and made a strange, elderly, purple man named gronstle on it
and then downloaded runescape
after all that I read almost twenty chapters of hpmor
I could probably find it somewhere in the stack of papers on my desk though
don't worry I barely remember how they work let alone the equations themselves
someone explaining the bayesian equations for probability and false positives is even more interesting than that
but you are actually right
I was going to present a counterpoint
actually that's true
but that stuff is much more interesting than some dude explaining angles to me
I have no clue
along with why the sahara used to be tropical
and about the East African Federation
ended up instead learning 31 logical fallacies
got distracted
I relearned a bit of 7th grade math
I did that for an hour
while I read hpmor
he chomped on some dandelion
I took plato outside
also in my defense i did other stuff in between
but this one is nerdy so I think I haven't degenerated any
that's true
it may have played a part in my not going to see the movie with you guys
like I really can't
hpmor is the thing once I start reading I just can't stop
but that's beside the point
not really
kind of
the buttons are close on phone
I almost deleted the server trying to change my nickname
I'll change it later
that's true
though I suppose I should change out of this
*you* are a fangirl
hmmmm no
it's the fanfic we didn't ask for, nor deserve, yet we were delivered
and hpmor
sherlock
there are two (?) things that make me giddy like a school girl in this world
I LOVE HPMOR SO MUCH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
off topic
that could work ~~better~~ too
build a table they like after destroying the table
welp
oh
no moreth problem, thee see
destroyeth thy table
but I don't know how to make you feel like you want to dien't so I'm a bit useless here
that's a tyler answer, excluding the last two messages there
why is that?
poorly worded
and your response was intelligent enough for me to not make fun of
no it's fine
if I expected one I wouldn't have asked
I didn't expect an actual response
if you gave a bad one I would make fun of you
just poking around
I wanted to see what kind of response you would give
nice addition
they are fancy
what are your thoughts on the ChristChurch massacre in New Zealand? What has led to this? How could it have been prevented?
let's get into the real reason I'm here
so
straight back at ya
how are you in that case
well
wait why would you ask yourself thatilackin
it's pretty frickilackin nice
we have
no
I love the guttural and terrible crunch and whimper
I, Shelby Lomax, take deep, immeasurable pleasure from stepping on dogs
i guess ill take the responsibility
that's true
you're not leaving me to do all the work
haha words
it's been vetoed
I refuse
no
you mean I have
well that wouldn't be very kind to do
yeah
but do you really have to be polite to yourself?
sure it's polite
out of all the things you could've
that's really what you say to yourself first to you met them?
I DID
no she didn't
and me
her
him
you
like me
many things lie
if you haven't noticed it lies
I technically wasn't typing when you all were
now is there gonna be anymore "there are more than two people typing" business
good sloopeth
(momentarily)
by fleeing
and I shall act upon this fright
whenever there are more than two people typing at once I get scared
you heartless hooligan
I accept
made my day
dang*
simply magical
hurrah
what are you running this on
it's just discord
jesus how old is your computer
just download it fool
she *clearly* wasn't joking
or at least that was an option
I think we threw someone in to appease satan
**and it turned out to be a portal to hell**
I strolled over to have a look
in one of my playthroughs a strange ravine opened up near my castle
I know
it's within the limitations
and that is completely possible
I've sunk hundred of hours into it
like that's not made up, I know the game through and through
some of the situations that arise are priceless
but my god
and the historical one
sure there is the strategy element
this is why I absolutely love ck2
***WOWW***
" 'it’s my fathers and wife’s daughter, and my wife is also my sister, so that makes her...' Alabama problems.﻿"

fair enough
that sounds like an overall unhealthy challenge to do

bye
not that im aware of
its still at 7:30
yup
indeed
spectacular
and we are the only people online
gus can go at anytime
shelby might not be able to go
im not going to any thing today
you already have your answers
actually
you all can answer at any time
exactly the reason why i applaud the violent acts of radical islamic terrorists
indeed
so does this mean the universe is ending or not, cause i have to get back to watering my pet cactus
heck*
one that we do not possess
this situation requires the deft hand of a skilled diplomat
something we may never recover from
in fact i'd go so far as to call this a travesty
weeg
not really all too nice
oh dear gus
oh dear
dead dad
i think its a relatively general human nature kind of thing to find that embarrassing
weeg this is **really** last minute to change just sayin
neither am i, though thats a bit obvious
or manage to find a cure to aging
like we meet aliens
i hope some really important forever remembered event happens on 4/20/69
its fine
indeed
ok bye again
the year 69 actually has historical significance, during it the roman empire was in the midst of a violent power struggle between four people, all of which who considered themselves the emperor
this is absolutely irrelevant to anything and everything happening but this is too magical for me to not share
indeed
goodnoot
surprising
b!poll should i kill myself
***M R C L E A N***
***he is a god you infidel***
weeg
I need to start a list
how may i take your order
welcome to hell
he has a total of only 110 messages
cause he's never on
especially brady
i dont have to manage either of them all too much to be fair
hell is getting pretty crowded
do i have to manage more people?
should we do a poll on whether i should kill myself
6
alrighty
indeed
abandon all hope ye who enter here
you cant go back now
welcome to hell
why hello young soul
im going to be a little late since me dad is late to home as well
maybe even 300%
maybe
magical
i seem to have forgotten something
i wouldn't
but you're right
every word you type you make it seem more appealing
plus i can always find a way to mask it
corruption is merely a tool of power, not a morally wrong thing to do
eventually i should get around to banning you
***YOU HAVE BEEN LET GO DUE TO MY BOUNTIFUL MERCY THIS TIME FOOLISH ONE***
***BEN WAS THAT THE FORBIDDEN L WORD?***
you'd have to be delusional to think that
gus johnson is not nearly as weird
deshawn you are the oddest channel I've ever found
sad
though if it exists I hope to go there to become a brutal dictator of it
freaking no one
me
I mean, it's hell it's mean to be populated with *way* too many people
this chat has been oddly dead
*I knew it was in me all along*
water just fell out of my hair and I don't know where it came from

because of this rapid and incessant calorie burning he has to eat five times that of what a normal child does
weeg
***only dance***
*no music*
*no stopping*
it's just *constant dance*
but it's really good
cause of a mental ~~illness~~ quirk
he kind of always is
he's already dancing
dancin' your way to the heavens
to space
up up
go full Up, but like
that's true
attach enough fireworks to him
kick him hard enough?
my lil jimmy has a suit made of literally wet paper
is this a safe activity for my child as well?
and the one about her exploring space and the moon concerns me

gregg eats an egg
egg
exactly
essential life skills
I know right
wow
perfect for children!
eventually you'll find it
the driving in the rain ones are numerous
the fun thing is that as you become older more will become relatable
thank god people have made playlists
I don't think so
I don't know
I can't stop
to these extremely specific 'asmr?' videos
I'm addicted
clearly not
has the name devolved too much?
pharmevey
pheve marvey
but ill go with amazing
I won't say it's perfect
everything about that makes me angry
but it's not an empty toys r us thats for sure
I don't know
I don't see what's perfect about it
an empty toys r us feels wrong

it depends on the author
it's a good show
yeah
he was drawn on walls, he never had depth
I, for one, think it's an improvement
I feel like I've seen it before

**me mum?**
**me mum is sherlock, dr. watson**
is that you sherlock
yessss
I'll take steve for the animal bot
c'mon they have to be better names than that
I like how someone mixed up the names for the bots for april fools and it hasn't been changed back
weeg
you wouldn't want to be alive when you are technically dead
oh alrighty
regarding the attack, we are pronouncing you legally dead for the sake of getting it over early
regarding the *wow* I have to say I have a way with names
I shall, in retaliation for improper quality, rename him *blargnot*
or blargbot is just a carp dictionary
I apparently lied regarding the word regarding
b!define regarding
welc
I return the compliment regarding the funnys
aw thank
funnys
haha
giving me a greater sense of self importance that is partially false
people sometimes like the funnys
I make many funnys
insert fat joke here
also it could probably exist if space time was warped enough
the whole point of me saying directions are switching is implying something seemingly illogical
up can be down and down could be right
***REALITY IS FOLDING IN ON ITSELF***
***DOWN IS UP***
***UP IS DOWN***
***MY FEET ARE LEAKING THROUGH MY HEAD***
***WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO***
***WHAT IS THIS MADNESS***
***WAIT WHAT***
im so confused
Keron, Karen, Karon?
there you go
hope it compensates
just double the amount of love the next couple of days
i feel like this chat has been blessed
amazing
wow
therefore it must be holy
alex jones just appeared as a military general for the army of mali in my game

what is confusing about it
makes sense
oh weeg
and while the lady was laying there dying the dude panicked and ate all the supplies in front of her
but they didn't know what to do
they had a full medical aid kit
one time I was watching someone panic too
that's unfortunate
well did it?
if it's an emergency they take off the nozzle fully on those glue bottles
to fix the fact you nearly blew her in half
a really big band aid
fair enough
that's true
on a pregnant woman would they shoot them or use the butt of it?
that gave me the strangest vision momentarily of a pregnant woman being shot with a shotgun
I need an abortion immediately
my child is 14 and plays a thing called "Fort Night"
like abortions
it would make things more interesting
you should apply that rule to everything
better late then never
byee
suicide attempt #12 has failed
so see y'all never again
I mean I'm still going to do it either way
jeez
but now you ruined it
well that was going to be the joke
nevermind I'll guess I'll fake it later
better late then never
welp
I should've faked my death for april fools
and a lot of concentration

i dont want to go back to my home country señor

also i cant believe you would cheat shelby
isnt trivia suppose be a fun quiz of your current knowledge base
***engorgio***
oh yeah definitely
get a jar of your Emergency Ant Suit Ants™
would wizards and witches just kinda try and gather as much things around them as possible to stick to themselves
imagine getting surprised attacked though without a wand
buy your Ant Suit™ today!
i have to be honest i laughed out loud when i read it
exactly
"What if you wore a suit of ants. The spell would always hit an ant and kill it instead.﻿"
with an interesting idea
then there is this dude
and how it basically cant be blocked
im looking through the comments on a harry potter video on how overpowered avada kedavra is
weeg
harry potter and the... what's that stain?
"If Voldemort was smart, he could've thrown baby Harry into the wall or out the window and kill him. No protective charm made from the power of love can save you from a brutal, Muggle-style fatality!﻿"
oh i got something better
"Guns are way more effective than avada kedavra. Let's see Harry's mother's love protect him from hot lead.﻿"
nice explanation
talking is just a mind reading but with hints
good morning to you too
goodnoot
I'm not sure how much longer we can hold them back but I'll sure try~
sweet dreams
au revior madam ravioli
I'm considering it
and it startled me a bunch
but I dropped my phone
I almost fell asleep accidentally
also I freaked myself out
weeg
or if he has an identity crisis he becomes agnostic
do you think when god goes through periods of self doubt he becomes an athiest
fun fact: jesus is an atheist
"jesus approves the art of suicide bombing"
I typed in chat
as black female lesbian jesus
while I was playing mount and blade
I must see this now
that's all I want
I want to see jesus act like another really stupid, self centered reality t.v. show person
but like
it would be actually interesting
reality tv show
or better yet
do you think that religion can be made into a game show
exactly
survival of the fittest
but hey
someone would die
weeg
I don't see why you couldn't
sure you can
all too distinctly
but I know the pain
at least with you guys it's more of a wildcard
well if she's going I'm not
it stresses me out
and *the only thing she does is complain*
I've actually been on a road trip of those proportions with her before
I don't think you understand
*she is absolutely not coming on the road trip*
***NO***
NO
NO
NO
alrighty
how long do goats live?
y u p
yup
ripperoni
im so scared of all of these ideas
but why
lovely person most of the time
god why
my mom
a part of the family
but also she said we should make you a schiller
I don't even know
which
i already sent the picture that my mom told me to make
my mom scares me more each passing day
well I'll always have those three dollars so
alrighty
three dollars
but like
any money is going to come out of the road trip
I'd pay money just to get out a lawn chair, sit down, and see what people do
in the morning some say they can faintly hear the incessant yet bored screaming of someone
but in a bored, mundane sort of way
yell out in the streets
oh obviously
I can give you whatever attitude I want in my head
it's through text
also being grump is fine
weeg I know the feeling
I'm not sure how I can help though
thats probably just cause I was still operating on an hour of sleep
but
I was feeling that earlier today when I got home
also don't die
probably because it's two in the morning
well it makes it sound like he doesn't care about the meaning behind the decorations
what's that supposed to mean
and that's all you can really get from the picture
likes game of thrones
he was a fan of ed edd and eddy
obvious interest in history however it's not an occupation
male and right handed
I think he's 25
he is in his mid 20s
then the u.s.
lived in the uk for 3 years
what I remember from it is that the dude was born in the Philippines, moved around a little
then I looked through his responses
then I asked you
the things I said were my guesses before I looked at the answers
I give up
it doesn't make much sense
it was out for at least a couple days shelby
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
im taking too long
even if I do it won't show a link I can send
now I can't find it
i accidentally clicked out of it
I'm seriously on the verge of homicide
where did I even find that
I swear I'm about to snap
this may take sometime
let me find the link
now the wonders of the internet is that such things can be confirmed
American male mid 20s right handed interest in history
that's pretty much all I got
very common
it's a lot more likely it's an american with european sympathies
there is quite a bit of european history, however the american history is there too
oh by the way I'm willing to say they are an american
along with the american history in the background
there is an old ww2 british war time new paper about the raf
it seems more so an interest, and it is very spread as well
now I don't think it's a part of his career
his interest in history
there's also the elephant in the room
it's balance of probability
you don't pick up and use a monitor
it's a lot more convenient to have the stuff you pick up and use on the side your dominant hand is
and yet the other stuff is also on the right side
going off the position of the mouse he is right handed
so mid 20s seems nice
the amount of literature suggests and older age however the aesthetics of the room implies younger age
im willing to say mid 20s
They are obviously male
I mean there was the basics that were overshot
no it's fine
it's near the door to their room?
using your amazing powers of deduction what can you figure out about them?

I've come across the coolest room I have ever seen
and I have to be honest
it's pretty cool
and see what people can figure out about them based off of that
that stuff
workplaces
is when people post pictures of their rooms
the most interesting part of that
talking about deduction one of the most interesting subreddits I have come across is one by the name of the science of deduction
now
I got a bit lost, disoriented, became mad, got better and then really happy
aha I'm alive
wait a momento
talking about deduction
can't be anything else you can't deduce
obviously
ah
that shade of pink
why is peppa pig
did you at least make an attempt to get them back
aw
***you don't have potatoes as hands?***
more inportantly
or
you don't have potatoes on hand?
maybe
also I'm sure they can in some way
which is exactly the reason why it doesn't sound too nice
I mean like damp kinda soggy
b!define soggy
mashed potatoes aren't soggy
soggy potato
you know what doesn't sound nice
that makes so much sense
really either way, it doesn't matter all too much
onions are just spicy potatoes?
I can understand beans but why onions?
what type of vegetable would be most suited for political office?
YOUR WELCOME
AND I HOPE YOUR HAPPY
SEEING AHEAD IN CIRCUMSTANCES CORRECTLY IS A REALLY GOOD THING
WELL GOOD, YOU SHOULD BE
ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF FOR PREDICTING THAT, AS USUAL IN THIS SCENARIO, I'M GOING TO BACK YOU INTO A CORNER
WELL GUESS WHAT, IT'S HAPPENING
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A MONSTER
what am I going to say then?
take a guess
and you know what I'm going to do to it?
I shall make a small mud apartment complex for the worms
I kinda want to build a small mud temple in my backyard just to throw people off
byee
that's true
as time killers maybe
they are fine
I gave up on the word search and fell asleep
I would love that
I wish you could just go to the store and get any size band aid like that
everything burns
I have no skin
but yeah
it's gonna take time to regenerate
it's actually nice on toast ive figured out
it tastes rotten
but it cronkles on touch
it moves like glue
it's crinkly
my fleshy shell has began to molt
weeeed
dee dee scares me
yahoop
yup
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_vPO8tekOOo
yahhh*
aye
b!define surreal
limmy's show can be so surreal sometimes
limmy
I'm not even going to have this conversation
I specifically don't want to
absolutely not
jesus approves the art of suicide bombing
night
good noot
ill see what i can do
ill look into it
strange
thats
well it was halloween
she held me against my will
she wanted me to make this

but my mom is insane
im so so sorry
incorrect
not now
sorry
what?
also my last message being 12 hours ago is kind of because I've been alseep
that's how I have so many messages
it is because I am the superior being
byeeee
I can't wait to literally collapse when I get home
I don't think it would work
I could try
I'm not sure whether I could stay home or not
try not to
oh jesus im dying
we shall be treated with sympathy
we have asked for forgiveness
weeg
bada boom bada bing
she has a picture of my face as a profile picture
I don't understand what is confusing about it
why wouldn't it be
I'd argue I'm even more dead
yes actual goodnoot~
I'll complain
when I wake up an hour later
so much so
I shall
have a nice nap
au revior madam ravioli
alrighty
but if you wouldn't have then I'm sorry
so I'm not sure whether you would've stayed up till five on your own
I don't know your sleep schedule
I don't know
sorry
I don't mind
meh
I may actually fall asleep in class if I get less than an hour
I was about to say the same
13 billion years of miracles led up to this point
well it's simple
cause it's from me gran
***dO yOu ThInK BuTtEr MaDe FrOm GrAn'S MiLk TaStE bAd?***
meanwhile, in sellersburg at 5 am on a school night
dO yOu ThInK BuTtEr MaDe FrOm GrAn'S MiLk TaStE bAd?
oh jesus christ
it's still milk
I mean
maybe with spleen juice but not gran milk
they harvest what is left before it goes bad
that's what I thought
can dead gran's be milked?
indeed
stuff
*that*
we just don't talk to her about
so I think we've reached an agreement
ill tell her, that her spirit child asked Mr. Clean whether his rectum was able to comfortably fit an entire Windex® bottle
do I tell her we talked for five hours, and circumcision was said only twice?
anyways how do I deliver these updates
*jEsUs iM fEArinG foR mY lifE*
it could cause the apocalypse
befriending each other
or might I even say it
but you teaming up
I just can't explain
you don't understand
I'm scared of you interacting more with my mom
at least I'm tall in my family
ha peasant
my family is just freakin short
you do you
plus there is the slight attractiveness bonus for guys, with women it's a bit more hit or miss
well being tall is actually on average linked to a higher salary
well I dream every once in a while
it's great
I feel like I'm tall
when I nearly never see anyone else for weeks on end but my own family
imagine what I feel like on breaks
also
I told her that all already but now it has a bit more power behind it
***how tall are you***
and she was a bit worried she upset you by opening up with
she was talking about it afterwards with me
but what was funny
if they have terrible taste then I have even worse taste
you have a way with the females of the household apparently

I'm not sure
she is calling you her spirit child
and
she has been asking for updates on you
im scared of what you said to my mom
off topic again
but it would be one of the reasons
well yeah
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO BE A POLITICIAN
I DON'T WANT MY FACE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT
OH NO NOT WITH THE FACE
oh god
"A tree just freaking consumed my left leg"
here is something I have said too much on the chat
yeah it would be
yeah
what even are some of my quotes other than the god, gran, milk one
oh dear
with Jesus doin the finger guns on there as well if you want even more
comic sans rainbow
but it has to be in
yeah
god is just one big gran ripe for the milking
yeah fair enough
Mr. Cleans gaping anus
the gran milk
the nipple destruction
the genitalia guillotine
but which one would they choose
I don't know why that seemed so strange to me
yeah I know
I'm not quite sure why
for some reason the Mr. Clean stuff caught me off my guard
at least most of the time for me
same
cause I can't tell anymore
I'm more interested in which one they would find the most disturbing
"***what does circumcision part two: electric boogaloo mean***"
"why did my dad have an obsession with male lactation?"
I swear passing down this chat would be so interesting
yeah
it's the hair and the baby face I think
how long are these tyler faces gonna last cause I'm taking myself less and less seriously with my face to the left of it all in some weird contortion
indeed
a whole culture specific to just our group which is rich with lore, due to these duels
I want to see full on, proper duels
weeg
all disputes shall be settled by foam on foam and plastic on plastic combat
indeed
oh
*nerf swords*
more than that
I'm sure as hell not going to let anyone leave that easily
well, I know one thing for certain
so I dunno
it would be absurd not to lose a single person in that crap-fest
we have all of high school to cover
while at the same time
but I feel like we can keep people
maybe it's just because everything is in full swing, and I think it'll keep going on forever
and statistically speaking middle school is the most volatile time for friendships
I try to be realistic instead of pessimistic
I don't know where to set my expectations anymore
like people leaving or coming
do you think the friend group will change
those are two different time scales
I really hope it happens
but I imagined that to be a part of it
there are light pollution maps of america as well so we could look at that
we pass through a bunch of no where so it would be really easy
I'm getting that urge
so I could see the stars the way they were meant to be
little light pollution
sometimes I wish I lived somewhere more isolated
unrelated note
but I don't know who I inherited it from
I'm pretty sure it's genetic in some way
I'm not sure where my excellent short term memory comes from
you'd be surprised
heck, you might have better critical thinking than me
but my critical thinking skills are sad and withered in comparison
which is the only reason I do real well
it's all (mostly) memorization
yeah
but it pretty much is
I wish it wasn't, cause standardized testing is the only thing that gives me pride and prestige
outdated
impractical
it's inefficient
but not caring about school isn't as stupid as you think
how dare they
the only reason I haven't tried teaching myself stuff before they do is laziness
anything they teach I can teach myself and faster
I don't worry about school much anymore
yeah it is
a bit stupid, I know
I'm willing to trade in hours of sleep for them
honestly I stay awake for the conversations
but since when was I known for good ideas?
and also sleeping is a good idea
don't hurt yourself
or I can just deal with school at three hours of sleep
I can't get in *that* much trouble
it would
I can call an anonymous bomb threat in
or better yet
I can't go to school like this
i tripped on a pencil and now I'm paralyzed from the waist down dad
I'm not sure what I can do other than wish along with you
did I even set an alarm for school
yeah I was gonna mention that
I hope you can see why I have an existential crisis every five seconds
even if we are just the equivalent of less than a blink in the grand scheme of things
I'm just thankful that we just so happened to be in the right time, at the right place to have the privilege of witnessing it all
but frankly I don't get all too worried about the end of the universe
it's just that entropy is bound to end up winning
and entropy destroying them
complexity building more and more complex things
everything is the by-product of the battle between the forces of entropy and complexity
well if you look hard enough even the universe dying is a beautiful thing
like how matter even exists in the first place
I'm talking about the true mysteries of the universe
or history going the way it does
I'm not even talking about the probability of parents meeting
frankly the probability of all of us existing is absurdly low
the universe truly is a beautiful thing
yeah
a bit longer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA
anyways
no offense meant
by now I've kind of given up on having an intelligent conversation on the same wave length as me with someone my age
you don't have to have smart responses
sorry for the length, I swear it's the last one
sorry to hit you with another video but I actually really like these
and the universe is going to last at least over a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years more
we are likely to live to around 80
and I'm freaking 13 here compared to all this
the modern era of technology only around 100
any form of civilizations 10,000
anatomically modern humans 200,000
animals around 500 million
the planet around 5 billion
13 billion years the universe has existed
the vast time scales
yeah
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBikbn5XJhg
and how small and minuscule humanity is to the inconceivable humbling
I find that stuff beautiful
the history of everything
I love space
I mean I have a heavy bias
I've watched these two videos and they actually gave me goosebumps
once more
to suddenly change the topic
interesting
was robinhood a commie?
weeg
I gotta re-read the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
the sherlock stuff was good
that was really good
the last book I read that I liked a bunch was Ready Player One
I don't have much of a favorite genre either
is there any genre favorites or preferences to a style?
that's something that I don't know but probably won't get a proper answer to
but with your scores sometimes I wonder what it would be if you read more often
ill start keeping track
you just not keeping up?
why would it come crashing down?
for how little you read you have a surprisingly high lexile and large vocabulary
you know
hopefully I find something
pick the one I actually want to read
my plan is to eventually just go through all the books I haven't read in my stacks and see which ones are reading counts
I haven't chosen a book to read
that would suck
it works a lot better then
if you can't do that have someone else hold you accountable
like really hard
but of course that's hard
try and hold yourself accountable
w h a t d i d I d o
not at this frequency though
it's happened to my sister's and mom's as well
it doesn't only happen to my ipad
I'm not sure
it's the only song on there too
it's just the regular music app that comes with the ipad that plays it
the only reason I've heard it a million times before is because it plays randomly
please stop
'this love'
the same one
weeg
this feels like a warning signal for something
send help
help
I'm not sure
randomly
a taylor swift song is playing on my iPad again
welp
THIS BETTER NOT
I SWEAR TO GOD IPAD
indeed
emma watson makes me not question my sexuality
she stronk
woag
I'm not complaining if it gives me a good excuse
I don't remember what was being talked about before

indeed


there are quite a few of the black and white ones

I still have that emma watson folder on my computer
goodnoot
it's a pretty normal thing
that's just what people look like when they are, ya know, leaning forwards
that's part of the reason it's good fool
she's leaning forwards
but I don't like it as much as the one that is my favorite
it is
I genuinely love it
that's my favorite you monster
oh also she's a world wide women's right activist blah blah blah
but I'm judging someone solely off their looks
that's a really shallow and mean thing to do
I'm not one to judge someone solely off their looks

ill send the same picture I had as my background for a while
I mean
she is amazing
indeed
she is a goddess walking among mortals
you are insane
ew
at least focus on the real world
jesus christ have some class shelby
but yeah
I'm going to ignore the fact you said I can smell it

I hope your happy
you have now joined the extremely large group that have ended up calling elsa hot in one way or another
congrats to both of you
what kind of weird domination lesbian relationship is going on here?
I was actually about to make a joke of the same caliber
yeah
well
she's an ice god
again
she'd rule us mere mortals and send us into a new age
do you have any idea what a real life elsa could do if she wasn't stupid
yeah, but elsa is pretty stupid plus it's a movie
well I don't know about that
elsa is basically an ice god she'd have to be stupid to be trapped
you don't seem very determined to fix the issue
go ahead
you have free range
seize the moment
don't seize up
if it's so biased I'd like to see you make it better than I
well I'm making it of course it's going to be biased
Taller Than Shelby Lomax
oh I nearly forgot
Professional Weakling can be tossed in there
well that's no fun and that would be a bit hard
indeed
there could be Aspiring Joke Attempter
other than being a smart idiot, have random existential crisis', and depression I mostly can't act upon there has to be something else
anyways
I'm gonna use that version of rip a lot more oFten
rip
it is fixed
however that one is one of the few that I follow no matter what
guidelines that I stray from repeatedly
most of my moral code is more so
also you are right gus
well that's getting more so into the proofs behind it but yeah that's what I'm saying
also its my basic moral code that says ending the life of any human being is a wrong thing to do and, yes unfortunately that includes me gus
same
depression and suicidal thoughts, but you can't act on them because it'll go against your moral code
but I'll take it
I'm not depressed, I just have a ridiculously low hedonic set point
aha you forget
what's something else?
random and stupid existential crisis'
blah blah
smart idiot
blah blah blah
anyways
interesting
mm
if it's so terrifying that you make a comment about it there must be more to it
well
I want your word
I don't want pictures or videos
continue
I'm yearning for even more information
please tell me more about the famed homing briefcase gus
but you'd have to like it about 45% of the time
you'd have to go an existential crisis every week or so
let's see what else
yeah
and I think you'd have to be smart but also really stupid
anyways I've been thinking of the requirements for the *highly coveted* honorary tyler title
weeg
I don't remember anything distinctive about the april's around here
yeah that's true
'pretty okay'
you sound very confident about that
pictures of my face
extremely flattering
especially these
I couldn't have asked for a better start
it's april
hey look at that
I'm gonna leave till April
sorry but we can continue this later please
no clue
not sure
do you think I can make people honorary tylers?
it's lovely
I know
not much
math reasons
ITD 11:37
FROCK
but I had to look at my face for an uncomfortable amount of time
not only because of the doodles
something I regret
and wow indeed
me smiling would look more unnatural

and you asked for a picture so I deliver
I'm perfectly alive
I don't really have many pictures of myself saved on my phone surprisingly enough
is the hair swoop just necessary for me at this point?
~~jesus~~ tyler, I do look four
its normal for me to look seven years younger than I actually am
oh don't worry it's just 6th grade me
and very high quality
a totally up to date picture of me
yeah
all hail tyler
bruh indeed
forgive me jim
wait a moment
that's what I'm talkin about
your a psycho
even situations you can't see
you gotta be prepared for anything
I don't know
just in case I guess
my god
ooooooh that gives me a good idea for this channel name cause it can't be cancer anymore
my god
sloopeth child
alrighty
well I stole this all from wikipedia
there are more categories
and
and the stereotypes on this strange creatures have been getting looser and looser as time goes on
as with time tradition changes
however those are the traditional traits
aha that is true
gentleness, empathy, sensitivity, caring, sweetness, compassion, tolerance, nurturance, deference, and succorance
usually traditional feminine traits include:
well according to wikipedia in the personality section
'girlishness'
or as the professors call it
this feminine culture
well according to my research
it sounds spooky
now I'm not quite sure what it means
some call it "feminine culture"
oh they are strange customs
and whomever fits them most should be more likely to be one
men-woes
I've heard of the strange customs of these elusive
there have to be at least a few hiding on the server
so statistically speaking
about 50% of the population is a way-mon
but according to my calculations
I'm not sure who it could be
I think so...
there are woe-mans hiding on the server
unless...
thou shall burn
so they must be fake
and sometimes just plain absurd
but frankly they are strange
well yeah there are stories
must be fake
I haven't heard of them
while listening to a really boring look at the habsburg family tree
I'm pet patting
I am
she's perfect
Charlotte is attacking her tail again
I'm perfectly and painfully aware of how unfunny I am thank you very much
it could be easily be read wrong
as in
"almost"
that almost sounded like it implies any of my jokes were funny
I'm just joking around
but sure
well I'm not gonna do it
I'm asking how you guys would feel if I got rid of the kkk and took complete control
what is there to elaborate on?
me
how would you guys feel if I just freaking slaughtered the kkk
I'm aware
it's fun
corruption is a tool
ya know
slop god
I support farming subsidies
well it's your fault you responded with tropico
weeg I'm looking at it
I wish to become the brutal dictator of a small island nation
I know it's very correct
"there's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution"
goodeth sloopeth
so we'll go with autocracy
but you made me realize a dictatorship is leagues more efficient than a democracy on here at least
I'm not trying to
I'll take that as a no for future elections
hopefully that will appease you all
actually get a government running
eventually we should hold elections for the positions
also talking about the kkk
it's alright
I figured
nein
nevermind
ew

yeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
that's not what I was thinking about but okay
interesting coincidence
I was busy geekin out about freaking boats and romans apparently
i know what it is but I never watched it
I'll ask tomorrow (later today?)
no clue
what my sister does is watch the same girl on YouTube talk about spoopy and paranormal stuff
my sister believes in ghosts and it deeply disappoints me
oh dear lord
***all hail bidoof***
I don't remember going through a pokemon phase and I still managed to have pokemon cards I accidentally found and gave to my sister
I think I have a bunch of the cars and stuff
like nascar
for a little bit of time I was into racing
that actually reminds me of a phase weirder than boats
indeed
*it didn't work*
I mean I have a bunch of hot wheels but I stuffed them all in a box and never played with them
alrighty
example?
you weren't boring, that just sounds more normal
I of course used it and it got a bit smashed up
weeg it was pretty cool
but my dad actually made me a custom Roman shield out of cardboard, construction paper, and tape
"thanks" - My Childhood
the history behind them
God I loved the Romans so much
one of my first was the Roman one
I had the whole boat phase
smol me was weird in the way I had distinct phases that popped up occasionally
in fact once I get my iPad charged I'm going to watch them as well
hold onto that
absolutely not
go wild
so have a field day
there are a bunch of other cardboardias
legoanimations6370 is a name I haven't heard in a long time
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jNa5zZbwRpE
I found yet another classic
I watched that one a bunch too
seven foot model boi
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dyiYg_84Rp0
ooooOooo
there were the lego boat sinkings as well
I consumed so much of this
imagine if you were a younger me, who was actually interested in boats
you think this is entertaining
if not more
I've watched all those videos at least ten times
I know it's amazing
the other cardboardias got a few millions views as well
9.3 million with this one
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoJE_tgRBPo
also the cardboardia series is legendary material
and it's all decayed and stuff
***yessssSS***
whamo
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQAQQlwKmw
not to hit you with another video but
DUDE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WAS THE COOLEST WAS WATCHING PEOPLE SINK DECOMMISSIONED BOATS FOR THE FISHIES
there are the cardboardia videos
that's a classic
ten million on this one
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-ICSJDUzc
it gets views man
like people get these boats, whether they be toy or model and just let em sink for youtube
for what it is
it's a surprisingly large genre
that's all I watched
dude titanic models sinking was my jam back then
yeah true
then repeat
I'd just get my playmobil boat and put rocks in it until it sank a certain way
not to spew any more random stuff but we got out the lil baby pool outside and I'd never get in it
an interest in boats doesn't sound like the most exciting thing in the world
I mean
it's not exactly my proudest moments
that I've came out of knowing too much about boats
it was an odd phase
I vehemently watched titanic documentaries
I know it's subtle
if you can't tell I used to be really into boats
heck, I even had closeable water tight doors
I had boiler rooms at the bottom along with cargo holds
the first class got an entire dining hall
1st class 2nd class 3rd class
I had at least a hundred rooms
the funnels
from the early 1900s
I also had an old fashion steam boat
oooh
I'm talking multiple stories of this behemoth
a really stupid looking dance floor
a pool
a tennis court on top
a bridge
engine
it had rooms
like a full on cruise ship
I used to have a cruise ship
all the worlds I've worked on are gone
I used to be really good at building ships
back when I played minecraft a lot more
actually
the last build I actually spent time on was that dirt temple
those fence pillars are my magnum opus
oh yeah
but never did I get farther than that on survival
sometimes I add a bit of flavor by keeping the wood by itself as pillars
weeg
~~but it's just an excuse~~
I'd like to think I focus on functional architecture rather than pretty
but otherwise my skill set is pretty basic
I mean I can almost build in creative
I'm no master either
now I'm just looking at minecraft builds
byee
personally I like the getting distracted, makes thing more unpredictable. plus it's just par for the course by now
aww
I applaud
seems reasonable and logic based
fair enough decision
sloopeth goodeth
but underground the shacks are actually useful rooms and ect.
I'm imagining like the perfect pet island with the thingies and little shack homes for yourself to go with an island aesthetic
I like that
is this humans live with the pets kinda big or is this just a pet island now
how big we talkin
that would be an interesting build
oooOoooOoh
that's true
that sounds like it would cost a ton
ahem
WEEG SANDWICH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
I love this island
weeg
plato would have a little garden for himself
thats sounds nice
I wasn't planning on leaving my pets behind
alrighty
I'll try some sneaky, stealth pats
charlotte is snoring help my heart again
nice flags
yep
***FRICK***
what if I say
perfecto
oh yeah
I suggest a flamethrower
that same uncle in maine had no limbs
actually fun fact
well mosquito hunters
but not impossible
it'll be significantly harder, yes
it's just that we are gonna have to accept that I'm going to have a near death experience
scooters aren't out
I'll somehow lose a limb to a scooter
also
ill just aim for april then i guess
I thought I was gonna have the honor of being first to march 31st
god dang it
**someone is gonna end up dying**
**oh jesus christ**
walking for eight days through literally no where sounds interesting enough
I'd rather walk
that sounds like pure torture
or walking for eight days
so it's plane
there should be stuff on google maps
unguilt yourself
well
but I don't have the handicap of a rat attempting to eat the universe
I am too
now how much does a plane ticket to down there cost is the next question
as you said we can always make the island pretty ourselves
nah I don't care
southern coast
so is it gulf of mexico
it's just the risk that comes with it
well we're gonna be subject to ocean storms wherever we go
that is true
but the gulf of mexico is really warm and has pretty water
some parts of the western coast can be really pretty
well the Atlantic can be a bit cold
it has to be near the coast
where are we gonna cut out?
talking about cutting out the land
the fewer people the less we have to cut out
alrighty
are you bringing family?
oh that's lovely
four if you have saws that are a bit blunt
it won't take more than three hours
I have a free day
anyways I'm thinking it could be an immediate thing
yeah
ah
the tree didn't help with the cutting though
alrighty
he did have a tree with him though if you want to count that
he went solo
yup
they are like bears
but that's what you get when you don't travel in groups
swallowed by a whale
tragic end though
I had an uncle up in Maine who did just the same thing
oh trust me it doesn't at all
I can provide the snacks
where mosquito hunters can get all the attention they deserve
float away and create a utopia
saw the land off from the mainland
I suggest we all go to a bit of pretty coast with saws
what we need to do is minimize losses and start small
I think it's too impractical to fix the corruption that exists on such a high level
can't trust 'em
this is what happens when you let aliens into the nation
the authority figures are all Gleeple Gloodles
and you know why the youth aren't paying attention to those values?
you know this is caused by the systemic break down of traditional values that make a society run in the first place
never do they mention the mosquito hunters
it's always iraq veteran that, afghan vet here
they don't get much recognition for their bravery, do they?
nothing is more dangerous than a wounded mosquito
indeed
oh how I simply swoon over the bravery of those Mosquito Hunters
dangerous work it is
but the dude missing his arm lost it to an ant
it doesn't show the part
looks fun
I wanna be a mosquito hunter
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BHBbJAIcnBI
I was called upon by my dad to explain it so I didn't have much a choice in the matter
also sorry i didnt respond i was busy explaining brexit to my mom
awwwww
***they found the schools***
its a government cover up
alex jones was right
you know the school shooting epidemic that has been plaguing america?
weeg
*three gleeple gloodles found each other*
but we know the truth
some attribute that to humans
extinction levels of disappearance
faster than ever before
you know how species are disappearing at a faster and faster rate
they are terrifying creatures
yeah
they move in herds
**vicious**
but when they meet each other they become
they are rare, and its even more rare to find more than one in the same place
squooshes on over and absorbs it
it kinda
a bit lost
when it sees an ant crawling about
well occasionally it gets the will to move
but its rare
its just kinda a breathing blob with some glitter thrown on it
no one quite knows what it is
The Gleeple Gloodle
the newest freak of nature that human's have genetically engineered
gleeple slide
shoot son
344
im not depressed, its just that my hedonic set point is ridiculously low
ya never know
this is of vital importance
I don't know what your talking about
well then ill guess you'll have to be left to burn as a heretic
what a trust you have in your father
indeed

for comparison here is the most current pie chart
finally december, january, and february:
december and january:

by the way here is a pie chart from december
please help me i cant stop making graphs
i randomly sacrifice my arms
alrighty
***this is a sign from jim that your mission is holy***
weed number should always be intended
good

and because i cant stop myself here is one from 3/18
you both broke the 10% barrier

by comparison this is a chart from before dank memer
statbot doesnt give an accurate image of total messages

a post-dank memer one
and i got a new chart
gluten tagg
do it
nice
oooh
woag
noice
that's only for real bad bois
frankly it's annoying and pathetic
you all need to stop begging for roles
now bye
no practical reason
I see no reason
no
sam
if you do without my permission your being replaced son
its dependent on roles
you cant
they are separate people after all
you should be able to
good
he got a gold wormy boi
nope
but i get your point
i was doing that to prove the point that this doesnt seem completely even
weed number
ha ha
insert homophobic joke here
sounds delicious
if she looks at more than the chat name your kinda screwed
not only does that involve cancer, which one in seven people die from, it also includes prostitution which thousands suffer from due to illegal human trafficking
you just made a jokey joke about "prostitute cancer" was my point jabob
i dont exactly understand how you can make jokes like that but cant have the channel named cancer
my mom had cancer and im alright with this
whats wrong with cancer
boi who changed this from cancer
always watching
I'm forever on
you are a fool
byee
au revoir, madam ravioli
if we're being real fancy
goodnoot to the two of you
but by all means I'm asleep
actually ill do it in half an hour cause I'm rewatching a video
which is what I shall do
it's probably a smart idea to sleep
and my arms are growing weary and my head laden with tiredness
anyways now that the magical minute has passed
the least you can do is act a bit somber though
well you don't have to cry at funerals
420
EyyyYYY
didn't know that part
sorry
oh that excuses you then
that's absolutely terrible
that's kinda what funerals are for
people tend to mourn at funerals
yeah that's not all too surprising
imagine trying to mourn with that freaking in the background
what a song to have at a funeral
my god
*should I add the song to my playlist*
~~or any comedy for that fact~~
but I'm not all too good at observational comedy
I feel like there is a group of words that could perfectly describe it
it's
I know
why this has so many views is beyond me
it's your average american who got a mediocre idea pretty much
interesting
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H3VLqLLWxbQ
it's ah
I got a video in my recommended called I think my dogs a democrat and it's a song
and I think I was talking a little too loud in retrospect
so I started talking to my dad about how papa got stuck in a plant
which I thought was quite humorous
I saw a plant, and part of its fancy scientific name was pawpaw
something that probably made me look insane at the zoo
best of both worlds
I'll just go with 1.5
ohalright2then
alrighty
1 or 2
right
humans always miss the important stuff
when the universe was 6900 million years old
there was a magical moment 6.9 billion years ago
yeah
at most two a day
it's actually probably for the best
you are completely and utterly insane
call in the H.E.S
well it would be worth a try
well obviously if you are able to be saved from such a thing you will be
don't otherwise I will kill you with my bare hands
don't slip too far into his personality
yesss
San Francisco
somewhere close to home and generic
that means your doing it right
good
maybe eating mcdonalds
the rest is him on his phone
the most he interacts is accidentally walking into the louvre and trying to ask the Mona Lisa for directions for a solid ten minutes
Blobblebirst in Paris
he's perfect for the show
I hate Blobblebirst so much
alrighty
oh god
oh
you can probably find the exactly right image
oh dear jesus
hands
oh so wrong
and it falls into the wrong
this is what happens when you give a random american young adult the power to travel the world
ah goddddddd
oh he's getting my blood boiling already
he'd call himself Quadruple B though
or who ever
so like Traveling with Blobblebirst
this normal travel adventure show
I'm thinking it would mislead you
I want to see that show exist
that exactly it
god yes
yeah
and freaking throws that privilege in your face by not paying attention to any of it
I want to watch a show where this person goes to amazing, spectacular places
that sounds worth it
that
but living life is better
I mean nest is good
it doesn't sound worth it to me
Will it?
your lifespan is being shortened by probably 10 - 15 years
you can't possibly be getting the proper physical exercise either
a very short life unless you also plan on consuming the proper vitamins pill form
or get someone else to do it
get the proper food and water
like
can you live like that forever
how so
ahem
he was a failure of a president
heck he wasn't even liked by all the federalists
and as you could imagine was used to suppress free speech
which is a really loose definition
he enacted the sedition acts which made it illegal to make a false statement about the government
there's a reason he only got one term
john adams limited free speech
she clearly knows nothing about history
not many remember him
liked him cause he is looked over
I'm pretty sure she did
did Mrs. Collier say she liked john adams as a president?
I dunno
i was thinking more so his deterioration as the allies slaughter thousands of young germans brainwashed into an ideology of hatred
this is a magical idea
w o w
that's actually a really good comedy video idea
wow
there has to be one where someone finger guns through all of them
you know those "I took a picture of myself every day for the last ten years" videos?
weeg
finger gun to victory
on a completely unrelated sidenote I keep getting decorations for my room and I'm loving it more and more
I don't mind
it's alright
that sounds amazing
woag
it's ash wood



my wand comes with one of those boxes and a thingy and it's so cool
why always now peppa
oh jesus christ
but if you feel that much joy over a notebook you may have a heart attack when you step into universal studio's harry potter section
that's sad
aw
I like it
harry potter stuff is cool
weeg
probably doesn't fit anymore
I think I have an old Ravenclaw shirt as well
I obviously had the bookmark
I used to have Ravenclaw robes and stuff I'm pretty sure
yeah I know it's awesome
I have a Ravenclaw scarf
I have a custom made wand
plus I don't have one
yeah
weeg
this stuff is mundane
they wouldn't be too surprised
but it's my parents
something tells me the response wouldn't be as much as you would want
alrighty
is there any specific time you are thinking of?
I'll just do it whenever I wake up
I will don't worry
"I'm going to major in Shrubbery Cutting, Growing, and Other Related Matters!"
walk up to my parents and tell them to their faces
with vigor and inspiration in my eye
I'm going to wake up tomorrow
you know what
anyways
I know
alrighty
sorry what?
I've been talking to myself for the past ten minutes
(and yes I know he wasn't short but it's just for the joke you know it all)
and carried with the blood and unusually short stature is a natural talent of shrubbery related matters
but his bloodline goes on
sadly he got a bit carried away with the emperor of france thing
he was good at it as well
apparently his dream was to be a Shrub Cutter
(yes the same napoleon who conquered half of Europe)
Napoleon the Great Shrub Cutter, Grower, and Eater
in fact they've told me of the founder of their great family
gromks dedicated to Shrubbery Cutting, Growing, and Other Related Matters
they are descended from a long line of dedicated gromks
it's kind of the Groncklestein's thing
but they paid anyways
turns out people don't care if you have a master's in Shrubbery Cutting, Growing, and Other Related Matters
useless degree it was anyways
they paid for my college tuition
of course I wouldn't live so close to gronkleberg if it wasn't for them
they practically vore my shrubs
the groncklestein family of gromks is the worst offender of all
i just wish I didn't live so close to gronkleberg
those darned gromks always chewing up my shrubs
where all those gromks live
gronkleberg
I think autocorrect is drunk
I'm scared
then why did byeeEe autocorrect to that
b!define guerrero
~~Guerrero?~~
~~**I said we will ignore that**~~
~~it's actually probably because I'm staying later than what I've accidentally set for myself but we will ignore that~~
that's what I thought
it kinda sucks
but still with headache
im happy now
I'm proud of myself
aha I have acquired liquids
goodeth sloopeth jabobeth
good sloop
woah
byeee
alrighty
this is around the same time
notice the other times I said I got headaches?
kind of misattributed it to the spamming
relating to the headache I have
no, that was interesting though
do you guys notice anything though
im sorry for leaving just not to get a headache that's a bit mean and stupid of me
MY GOD I GOT IT
of course
sorry but bye, I just don't want another headache
I'm hopping off again till this turns tolerable for me
I liked the N better with the Ñ swirly
to the cesspool it shall return
from the cesspool it comes
I don't like how this is spiraling into cancerous cesspool again
there's your answer
well
oh
maybe they do
everything gets buried in cancer nowadays
I know it was buried pretty fast
I love these cats on a task to be on glass
I never said I thought it was me
why jabob
hello definition of colon
you know how we make sentences?
I thought of a great game
I'll definitely see her in the morning
I will
but I like giving my pets free will
nice rhyme
I want charlotte so bad now
weeg
that's adorable
toe beans
toe
ah
ahem
oh mY GOD LOOK AT THAT LIL BALL OF FLUFF
they gave meth a pass?
awww
they can be pretty fast
they're in glass?
they are bass?
I think I got it

that's really what I needed
~~killing the joke maybe~~
I don't quite get it
can you walk us through this
this is kinda hard
ah shoot
jesus in bats

SHOOT

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
***YEAH***
WHAT A WAY TO LEAD INTO THE NEXT DAY
MY GOD
YEAH
THEY ON GLASS!
CATS ON GLASS
THEY ON GLASS
THEY CATS
I REPEAT
they on glass LADY'S AND GENTLEFOLK
they on glass?
but I didn't figure you'd come up with it
that's definitely something Me would come up with
I'd expect it if I was talking to myself
I didn't really expect it
anyways
national news coverage
mentioned in your local newspaper
oh yeah
fair enough
well it depends on whomst you murdered
holi pepperoni that was good
all around you
like
is it okay to have a lump of cancerous flesh grow an extra layer of protection
but anyways
much like me
actually technically it was a very big, and embarrassing mistake
didn't even know it was possible
I won an Oscar for my transitions before
I know
but talking about cancer
weird question
I didn't have this on
the hell
Taylor Swift?
ah it seems to be generic song 143
oh shoot son
did I leave it on
music is playing from my ipad
what the heckko
I'm ignoring that
are you proud yet
I made a line dad
~~~~~
WOAH
~~I'm amazed~~
~~these thingies (~) do this~~
well yeah
clearly
how long did you spend on that
I'm real scared now
please no
spookie
he still asks me about it to this day
that was more than three years ago
I told Brett that ill sell him weed
byee
oof
a h
this isn't my fault, Jacob your the one talking about prostitution
but just let the record show
yeah probably
does poor gus have prostitute cancer?
there aren't many questions I can answer
w h a t
you must be somewhere in between
top left
look at the thingy in the background
it's patrick
here be demons
warning to all who dare enter:
I'm scared
jesus christ burn it with fire
you need rehab
that is absurd
I know nothing about the bot I invited
this squirrel is slow
alrighty
McDonalds
what am I to do now
I am now riding a squirrel as we speak
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XuI6GTY9eVc
I think the guys of the server will find this video extremely helpful in the future
and hello
I'll join that discord in a little
popping back in
hopping out
sorry that I haven't killed myself yet
hopping in
anyways im going back to my weird state of existential crisis, worry, anxiety, and a little bit of suicidal thoughts mixed in there for fun
noice
right
third times the charm
ill give her many pats later though
shes gone now
while i was trying to eat pizza charlotte was on my lap and she was trying to eat it and it gave life meaning to me again for five minutes
bye
I've got to work something out without killing myself, so I'll be gone for a while
yay congrats everyone we got something planned
if everyone is alright with that
maybe 5:30
if we are going at 3 then sometime between 5 and 6 would do
if we are going early we are leaving earlier than usual as well
when can you be there
i have no clue
alrighty
please
like less than an hour from now early
i know
no im pretty sure thats right
we dont really know i guess
byee
i slowed it down to 15
later we'll hold a second vote with the new stuff in place
this is just impractical weeg
if you all lay off the bot spam then maybe i wouldnt need to use slowdown
thank you
if any of you can find it that would be immensely helpful
i looked through the list
there isnt a command to lock off certain channels i think
im trying to slow you all down
thats because you all just wont stop spamming commands
dont use bot commands on this chat sam
i know
im slowing it down to an excessive 30 seconds between each message
maybe we should actually kick the bot off
its just the bot
they arent having conversations
they arent active
by all means they are still dead
what is going on inside their heads
they just dont stop
they keep spamming those messages
jacob and sam are scaring me
please dont
so restrain yourselves
i dont want to take away those permissions just to have this slowdown to work
if you want to keep that i suggest you not to spam the commands like the others
by the way <@&528425146483212292> you all are immune to slowdown because you are moderators, and have manage channels permissions
we'll take this to <#528430979786997770> alright?
do we actually need to make a decision on whether to keep dank memer or not?
this is freaking absurd
JESUS
its asking too much just to have this be a controllable, nice chat isnt it?
the discord is slipping into anarchy more and more each day
i dont know anymore
i dont know
we could try getting in a more simple bot
do i need to do this stuff manually?
i did but at what cost?
god
leave only what we must have and see the activity drop
purge the discord of everything
statbot is next to be banned
yeah
everything is going downhill
i dont know anymore
use the <#560867423339937792> channel for commands
sam use the bot channel for dank memer
alrighty
shelby do you want to go to the fallout shelter or is that too much
please go to the botty channel for dank memer
t h i s i s a h e a l t h y c o n v e r s a t i o n
everyday i feel more inclined to press that ban button for dank memer
you all have an issue
no
Will I?
yes
should I relish the quiet?
and with that I leave you all
dumbledore was known to his lovers as dumblevore
anyways this joke won't be as fun because not a lot of people are on but
*interesting*
**The Cascade** is a yoyo?
I'll act like I know what that is
skeletons aren't alive though
nice
your welcome
welcome back to hell
it's sleeping in late cause they stayed up
well it's not that
like I'm gonna forget my jokes
sometimes it's just plain annoying
I don't like the fact that barely anyone is on in the morning
anyways I'm off
and you didn't have to pull my nine year old sister into the mix
hint and point at your comments about my sister
no not exactly
oh fuck off
blah blah blah notify me
I'm choosing now to leave
can you not talk about my sister that way
she's nine you freaking monster
no please
then jesus
if she actually opens up
it very well could be
but I have a feeling that it would be nightmare fuel for me for days
simply because it's a wildcard
god you two together is a terrifying thought
I'm pretty sure she has
and it's very odd
occasionally you sound like my sister, just with a better ability to communicate
why?
so I'm checking if it's just coincidence
it was roughly the same feeling, same time, same situation
checking with Past Tyler on stuff
alrighty
how many days ago was the 25th?
this is strange I'm getting a headache again
before you know it your hospitalized
you get up, despite the injuries, and keep walking backwards
ect. ect.
and so walk backwards more aggressively
only to fall again
so you walk backwards
you get angry once you fall
it's a spiral
it's just a loss you have to accept
well some people very similar to you would find a way to still fall
you just walk backwards or forwards depending on how your feeling
yeah
both are beautiful in their own way
wow
I'd just give myself a headache
frick that's frustrating
I had something to say that I've kept in the back of my mind but never got to and it slipped
CRAP
thats a good idea
but I like it more open
it's itchy
I made a nest out of human hair, which I curl up inside like a cat and sleep in.
goodnoot
I don't knew whether I've quoted worse or not
I remember
yeah
didn't santa linger on that stuff
I suggest quotations
ah
was that even a quote
I remember that
there have been much worse quotes than whatever you are pulling up
that's fine and acceptable
things I haven't done?
am I held accountable for quotes?
one is
one is not from us
exactly
HOWW YOU BIASED BAMBOO BEAN
ARE YOU HOLDING ME MORE ACCOUNTABLE THAN SHELBY
WAIT A MOMENT
yeah I was quoting it
what did I freaking do
she can explain for herself
wat
May I remind you what question you asked Mr. Clean Shelby
dude it's just typing 'dildo'
sure
nOoOOoOOot
goodnOot
o h ?
oh dear
that's a funny event
opened only occasionally
hence the usefulness of the shelter
no one else can read it
I notion for a purge of this server
it's not silent enough
I fixed it
I saw and I'm aware
no you can't
actually better yet if anyone actually wants to ask, or talk to me notify me and I'll open the <#554125834659692554> so we could have a proper conversation
if anyone needs me just scream loud enough
I'm going back to my hidey hole
five freaking minutes
god dang it I'm on for five minutes and it devolves
we do
clearly you all can't be trusted with the most basic of luxuries
yeah
what have I done
this is too constant a flow
jacob you need to stop
you just keep going
this feels like watching someone with a drug addiction
this is seriously scary
Jesus Christ
you all are addicted
and I screwed up falling asleep horribly
shoot I missed 11:11
insert obligatory joke here
interesting
I'm going to sleep
in the mean time
I'm on it
what is it
oh darn diddley, Durable Dude Dave does drugs

tickle the tackle
bickle the backle
frickle the frackle
ripperoni in pepperoni
dang
i hate geometry
that was easy
god i miss tintin
i gave up like twenty minutes ago
its up to you
thats what we are talking about
i havent even gotten to freaking hosting
i dont think i can get much further with downloading the server
but i keep getting errors halfway through
i get to the point of downloading the server files
i dunno
it would be
ive at least gotten to the point of downloading
im not the smallest though and thats all that matters
ive tried different things but im a big stupid
same
alrighty
i can try and set it up again i suppose
nope
307
alrighty
(by exploded i mean it took a long time, then just stopped completely i think)
i tried to make a minecraft server but my coomputer nearly exploded trying to create the files
fair enough
thats odd but alright

you are 99% gay fool
or 4.5
actually three is probably right
5.5 Billion Years
pls howgay
w o w
lets see how fast this goes downhill
byeee
its a yes for both jim and dank memer
both seems excessive
i think we can agree on him
i dont know this dank memer bot looks pretty appealing
there is a howgay command
woag we may get him
i dont want anyone to have a head start or anything
we could always add something less multipurpose because simplicity
this thing
https://unbelievable.pizza/
it would take some configuring
its an economy bot with a bunch of other commands
i know UnbelievaBoat bot
just adding an economy bot
we arent doing any major changes to roles
we could have wages dependent on roles, or maybe dependent on messages
yay or nay?
how do people feel about an economy bot
ill do that later
its just kind of there
im not quite sure why your channel still exists
i could add an economy simulator bot to spice things up
if this server wasnt as cancerous i would actually kick you but then bring you right back, but if i did that there would be a freaking uproar
y o U a Re g O na A gEt s Mo tE n
give me the nerd role and i smite you out of existence
disappearing into a mist of cleaning products
your welcome
by all means this is a win for you
you get what you want
not really
you are still a planny boi
i can do side roles
nice
it made sense
i liked that yeah
this is absurd
out of the eight people online there are six separate roles
what the heck is happening with the roles here
what would be the use of that
gluten tagg
i dont quite know what you mean by making it a "group"
we usually do
this is a new low even for deshawn
t h e v o m i t o f g o d
I can't even stay up if I want to
this is very troubling
apparently if I lie in bed for just a second I fall asleep
I don't have control over when I sleep now
that's more like it
clearly
why must you tarnish your good name so
why mr clean
elephant drinking from the toilet?
wat
you waited a till it was the next day to say bye
woah
byeee (again)
you aren't all too good at this leaving thing
for the past five minutes
I don't like it one bit
I don't like it
toe truck
right
why leave on that
id really rather you not
hopefully don't die from that carbon monoxide
byeee
alrighty
don't die
that was seriously weird
Note #2 Shelby Lomax is attracted to Mr. Clean
I don't know what to feel
I don't know what to say
***jesus christ***
you are the one who escalated most of that
however
I feel immense and immeasurable regret for getting on discord now
***¿¿lies regarding the size of Mr. Clean's anal cavity??***
**that's what you essentially did**
**Shelby you asked him whether he had a large, gaping anus capable of fitting Windex® bottles inside**
why would you need to know if it was factual??
"can you confirm"
you should have stopped when you asked
good god what am I doing with my life
the rest you can read on wattpad
"He then began to quickly choke me down with Japanese Cherry Blossom scented Windex® and I knew that at this point I was doing this for Mr. Clean."
"I was now accepting and comfortable with my undeniable and determined fate and the wrath of Mr. Clean."
"Mr Clean reached out towards me with his big, muscular, *daddy worth hands* and broke open my jaw to a 110 degree angle to shove the large funnel down my throat."
"He quickly unscrewed the cap and brought out a funnel as I lay there with a crystal clean face."
you are definitely not clean though shelby
M R C L E A N
s h e l b y
"Before I knew it, he reached into *his large* ***and gaping anus*** *and he pulled out a bottle of Windex®*"
forgive me for this next part
"He took out his crystal clean sponge and at over a thousand thrusts per millisecond cleansed my face straight into the bed."
"I knew there was no escaping now."
"He body slammed me back down into my bed as I was mid-flight."
"I quickly hopped out of bed, but I was no match for Mr. Clean's raging speed."
g o d
even if it didn't come from god
nah Mr Dirty is just better overall
xxx_mrcleanismydaddy69_xxx
that's a thousand times better than what I was going to say
***wow***
I'm already reading it
what am I doing with my life
you just want that thicc picc
you aren't worried you liar
you must be way too excited
jeez
be patient
**I yearn for it**
w o w
it depends on what kind of quality and stuff we are admitting of course
but might I add, I could get five chapters finished by the end of the week
güt bye
of course sir

"Mr. Clean: Dirty Job"

ALL HAIL MR. CLEAN
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY BABY
I SWOON FOR YOU MR. CLEAN
YES
I WORSHIP YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR
MR CLEAN STAY ALIVE
if I was feeling like a jerk I would say no

also its kind of impossible to be all of those at once
you did
pastafarian I think you mean
just barely as well
here to cleanse the world of jews
Mr. Clean is here
you are odd
you don't need to say sorry every time you misspell something

that is an incredibly odd need
my god there should
the amount of homosexuals in my family tree feels statistically unlikely
and now I have the first deadly sin
my god I'm actually going after the Farrier's apprentice
like father like son
I'm going for it
no, I had better keep these thoughts for myself (no effect)
the Farrier's apprentice (gains trait homosexual)
the Carpenter's Daughter (no effect)
the choices are
"I've been having these special feelings for a special someone lately. The strange urges to find myself embraced and close to another person. If I could only find myself alone with..."
it reads
secondly YeS
I didn't name him, his mother did
firstly
finally
OOOH 14 YEAR OLD FERDINAND IS GOING THROUGH A SPECIAL EVENT
and rightly so
respond with an equally concerning message
so two people consecutively dying at the same age
my grandfather/uncle died at 24
my father died at 22
also correction to myself
that's nice
wait a moment im 11 not 4
I'd buy a self stick for that
I've spread my addiction
meanwhile i have to wait around 12 years
i should be fine
and i live long enough to have a male child
just as long as i dont get unlucky
the 20 year old dying was bad luck and negligence
im hoping he doesnt
and a female ruler is kind of a death sentence for a dynasty
it goes to my aunt/mom when he dies
like my dynasty is over if he dies
he *cant* die
im scared for this 4 year old
then 20
then 40
the first one was 60
the lifespans of my characters seem to be less and less
the family tree is kind of screwed up
and theres not many children with living parents
well its been generations since helene
its a family heirloom at this point
i still have the skull of helene
alrighty
sea shanty 2
i just got lucky my uncle killed himself and passed the county down to her
a county i lost a couple generations ago
its bringing in a county back to my children
the cousin marriage is strategic
and they were kind of childhood friends so that worked out
and also i like having a wife i have a high opinion of
the aunt marriage wasnt for strategy it was moreso just cause i can
i love it so much
if it makes it any better there was only a five year difference in age i think
it was a very odd marriage
this time on ck2
im playing as the four year old incest baby between his dad and aunt/mom
both of whom were gay
its fine ill just move it down
WELL PLAYED
WELL
**so ha**
and you are currently eating nothing
well im currently eating crackers
well i HAVE saltine crackers so ha
had?
i have saltine crackers one again
also fear me
i will nom on spicy flies all i want
oh dear
there really wouldnt be a difference
like if you type in yellow spicy flying raisin into that Scribblenauts Notebook Thingy you just get a bee
bees are just yellow and black, spicy, flying raisins
h i s w o r d i s l a w
m y g o d
double B single R isnt as good as Triple B
but wow
i mean its accurate
also where the heck did you hear "A bee is a spicy flying raisin" from shelby
i dont know
its still there though
but its a duck __cult__
is that against the rules?
yet i wont
your fearmongering
i have no reason to listen to your blatant lies,
im a skeptic at heart
we will see
i dont plan on surviving long anyways
~~long live~~ all hail greedo the bounty hunter
may he burn
greedo the bear is fake you fool
guess who is in charge of my realm now
i identify as a queek
quick quackle quock
quack my duck brother
yes i see
im willing to tolerate one a day
excessive
thats
indeed
apparently VERY different thresholds
we just have different thresholds
you can very much have enough goats
the louisville zoo
"ive had enough goats for one lifetime"
i said and i quote myself
no we didnt
walking around the zoo for three hours does not make your legs feel great
Note #1
fair enough
I need to take a buzzfeed quiz to see what peppa pig character I am
it's fine
ah alrighty
I'll take silence as a hint and go watch something on Netflix
I think it nearly killed me
how could you go against that
it's a beautiful Monty Python skit
I'm trying to talk about a penguin on top of a tv now gus
I will later
neither
https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2pc3dx
also I can't find any YouTube videos
cool
it's about a penguin on top of a television set
wait a momento while i transfer downstairs
i think i nearly cried laughing because of monty python
i was dying momentarily
sorry i didnt respond
what is the feel of the word
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522534502359236609/554503861671428096/Incest.png
alrighty
and then as that character married my cousin
died
had a child
so i married my aunt
what happened was that my character died
i didnt?
2. married my cousin
1. married my aunt

jesus christ
***which is obviously the most realistic portrayal of trials ever***
watch the bee movie
i think he can take a break and
teaching law students
10 years experience
he's qualified
i actually just watched that video
truly the people with the most sociopathic tendencies use emojis unironically
w a t
that makes sense
oh alrighty
byeee
h o w
it happens
desecration of a corpse
it is
its against the law
its no restrictions of freedom
its still animal cruelty
**poor dogs**

you did this to yourself
what a transformation
wow
but
yeah
looked nothing like dr. phil
when dr. phil
oh the 60s


he has changed so much
i know

i found a picture of him from the sixth grade
also talking about a teenage dr. phil
my god ow
and its one fanfiction finished
twenty minutes in

there is a way to directly send it to discord
im trying to send it
there is no way
there is no way i sound like that
i think there is purposeful distortion of my voice on here
oh it starts with mr. blue sky
that
well
but we spent a terribly long time on
i started it a little bit before
god
it like 50 minutes long
i dont even want to listen back to the recording

im just not gonna question

my typing speed has increased fourfold
and seamless transition over to the computer

woag indeed
**The Unstuckening**
I solved world hunger by
*enlightened*
I feel
indeed
and now its on and the button has unstuck
my finger pressed something
so I kinda just poked around
I got the front off I was very confused as what to do next
I'M ALIVE AND THE COMPUTER IS ON
AHAAHAHA
I HOPE I DIDN'T TOUCH TOO MANY WIRES AND CORDS
I FIGURED IT OUT WITHOUT KILLING MYSELF
AHA
also sorry for the response time, currently the front of my computer is disassembled just to fix this one freaking button
something tells me you don't like that
(or you know change habits)
enjoy it while it lasts
frick frack the computer on button is stuck
that's right ladies and gentlemen, you get more than one and so much more than two
Improved Mental Health
not too far away is...
if you've done your proper research you would know
most people come just for that, but there's so much more

welcome to Waking up at Reasonable Times
imagine actually waking up like this but it's every day
natural light can do wonders for the mind's condition
so if I wake up at the right time there's sun light that's really pretty overhead
I've said this before but I have a window directly above the start to my bed
especially if you wake up at the right time to where the sun is just hitting your house kinda and there's yellow light beams that form and stream out of the windows
weeg
from the limited views I have of it through small rectangle glass holes
outside is pretty though
it feels like your going against the laws of nature
my god it's a miracle
carp I don't remember how I even fell asleep
a late awwwww
I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT
NO
GRYFFINDOR
BUT HAGRID
AT LEAST THE DUMBLEDORE STUFF CAN MAKE SENSE AT POINTS
HAGRID IS HUFFLEPUFF
dude
and had an intimate relationship with Grindelwald
like I don't give a carp whether Dumbledore was gay
he is literally the embodiment of hufflepuff
there is no way in hell that man is Gryffindor material
he was a gryffindor
but get this
if a bit dull at times
i mean lovely guy
you know what angers me the most about hagrid
dobby is suffering from terminal cancer
God I hate her so much now
plot twist god pulls a jk rowling and Jesus turns out to be an oppressed gay man living in rural india
IT'S INDIAN JESUS
good luck trooper
I don't know if I like where we are going
what the hecko
that's sad
also one carries a potential death penalty the other is 20 year max I think
that doesn't work as well in text
accidental manslaughter
sorry it wouldn't be murder
was the baby convicted of murder?
then I got even more confused from that
I got confused for a moment and I thought that I actually heard that from somewhere else
I think you said that before
I remember that somehow
I
"my mother raised me to kill"
there's no stopping them
those bloodthirsty babies
extra points if they can walk
they go at each other
weeg
I know
like dogfighting except it's with kids
***now***
I want infant gladatorial combat
like I'm gonna cause permanent damage
teach it to fight
your baby's blind
oops
and next thing I know
things get out of hand
I'd do something stupid like start playing with a sword around it
because I'm gonna corrupt that thing to the core if I spend a totaI of an hour with it
I guess I don't trust myself around babies for long periods of time either
I'd rather that fire kill it than me dropping it halfway out
under any circumstances
but I will not hold a baby
I don't go to such irrational lengths
I don't know if they were ever cute to me in the first place
plus they are disgusting
but they have enough smarts to enact plans without thinking of the consequences
they are demons that act solely upon instinct
I think kids have lost all their cuteness in my mind
plus you have to go through decades of their bullcrap
I mean human beings just suck
yeah
who would ever want to willingly do that
being a mother sounds like it would be terrible
that would probably be a good idea
so you were expecting too much
ah
well what were you expecting?
hm?

sorry?

weeg
or at least it sounds easier to win
playing cards against humanity in real life is easier
I remember every one of the cards for you I chose being good
but how
I think you actually did get a good hand there
I'm just confused
it's fine
YOU SAID IT WAS CRAP
DID YOU GET A GOOD HAND AGAIN
HOW ARE YOU PICKED SO MUCH
BUT HOW
NO ONE IS GOING TO MAKE A PROPER HAIKU
THAT'S OBVIOUS
Well yeahH
HOW WAS IT A STORY
WHAT THE HECK
THOSE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE
DO YOU HAVE THIS RIGGED
SHELBY I SWEAR TO GOD
bye
alrighty
haiku time
nopw
and a measly twenty feet
last ones were millionaire
fifty don't statue
it's billionaire now
it's different
and your welcome
yes
I have no clue
how
a finger painting thing gotten out of hand
like
cause I played it
and that's extra
it actually made me laugh
c'mon
like
I like the vagueness of the finger painting though
well yeah
***finger painting***
and
incest
bestiality
interesting
these are
welp
that is if you don't want them picked
if you want to get rid of cards like those play them when they don't make sense
statistically
by now its an automatic winner
YES
I really hope they pick it now
also congrats
but rarely are they played right
absolute bombs when played right
I mean the long ones are nice
most open to interpretation
those are the best ones though
I have a pretty bad hand
choose mine or die
why
one of mine
or rather
this card was misspelled
that was deserving
do they just hate everyone else
do they seriously think that's the funniest
why was that chosen
alrighty
interesting
this card actually exists in the game
weeg
that was good
and self loathing had to win
it was self loathing or estrogen
good job
don't errr
don't
this one is between
ooooh
sure
oh dear shelby
old macdonald was a plantation owner
black people
but brain tumor
I mean good job
HOW WAS THAT CHOSEN
***a brain tumor***
mine are usually pretty obvious
thanks
choose mine or die
uh
that's
the hell is the first card
*being a woman*
the card looks just as confused as it's player
why is it a question
"bees?"
I swear these public games are rigged against me
there
you know which one
yup
how does one do that
this is a good round
this
EYYYYYYY
good job
~~weirdo with a nazi fetish~~

EYYYY
apricot
mine or hers?
what are you guys even talking about right now
name one and I'm in
i don't care which server
I'm in
especially if I can distract myself
should be over in no time
it's just a headache
I don't need to do anything extra
I should be fine
ouchie
i gave myself a bit of a headache now
alrighty
that's probably it
suddenly changing the topic to something less funny
I don't know
sorry
anyways
but yeah
not really all too special
a thing
yeah I don't know
a special flavoring this time
crisis
I was just hit with a sudden pang of
that's a step forward
they hit you hard enough to get you on the floor
I mean
sounds like it
from the pain or joy?
what the heco Mr. English
double U?
I know
what was it this time
ah
yeah
Greedo the Bear
by a certain
murdered presumably
Will greedo leave a body?
even if that's passed
how many were there even suppose to be
was there enough signatories on the will?
never got to see the road trip
too bad
oh shoot son she dead
oh god what's gonna happen to yous
WELL I DON'T HEAR A GREEDO NOR DO I SEE HIM SO YOU SHOULD GET YOUR BRAIN CHECKED
I HEAR LIES AND EXCUSES
OTHERWISE I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE
I WILL NOT BELIEVE IN GREEDO THE BEAR UNTIL HE REVEALS HIMSELF
not whatever sham bear your talking of
this is the real greedo

anyways
is he dead?
alrighty
erm
goodnoot
I think he is the imposter
I don't even know who greedo the bear is
imposter
the rodian
¿¿¿the alien bounty hunter???
greedo shooting
why would you even edit that in
weeg he did shoot first
it wasn't 50/50
I'm pretty sure han did shoot first
it sounds like a 50/50 chance
they may take the chance to kill you during the conversation
hey
maybe you should
the advance must be astronomical
also I don't think someone pursuing a career of murdering for pay is going to go hungry
I got the rest now
all I had to do was search for the message then jump there
thanks I got it now
alrighty

also I think I have a problem
"okie doki yello"
but the first message was
on announcements I think
testing testing big boi billy big boi billy
why would you hire hitmen on yourself
how close were they?
slip into the way
you can just so happen to
did you try and step in front of the darts?
but doing the job for the assassins wouldnt be all too nice
oh alrighty
what does this have to do with anything?
sure
yes
what do you mean what number do you have to be on, do you mean the percent?
to be that pitied
i mean imagine how bad they would feel
but they will know they didnt do it
what did they do this time?
ah shoot
the normals
penguins
the hitmen
themselves
its fun
interesting
when did everyone else join?


that would be cause for celebration
maybe they actually end her this time
they are pretty pathetic
they arent that skilled
weeg
im pretty free going considering moderators
im not that strict
not only are they over seeing more people
well yeah
crap
im an excelent driver dont worery
haha im texting and driving
well yeah
i dont know about who
my sister is screaming "***SHE THICC***"
ah okay
erm?
well it would have been better if some ambiguity was left but i get joy out of ruining my own jokes
i was more so referring to the dream i had of jumping in front of a semi than actually doing it
like son like father am i right?
he jumped in front of a semi
pretty tragic story
yeah
forever
my dad came into the house, said "**i faiped**" then left
you faiped so hard you misspelled a word
t h a t i s q u i t e t h e n o t i f i c a t i o n
oh thats terrible
what the heck was my 8 year old self doing?
please control yourself gus
but they are so forgettable
like i've watched some of these before
how can you all even name shows like these
its broke the 8/10 barrier
according to reviews girl meets world was actually average
another solid 5/10 star show
yes it is
i've probably watched an episode before
i didnt even know it existed
it was good occasionally
jessie wasnt even great
and should tell you something
which is kind of pathetic
anyways shelby none of the shows break the 8/10 barrier
then dont
look at the ratings
and jessie almost barely doesnt suck
shelby almost all of them but jessie suck
bunked is a spinoff of jessie
and i only know they exist for real because i had to google them
at least the ones you guys have talked about
they really are mostly the same
all the disney shows blend together in my mind
so i cant say much i guess
but i dont know many disney shows
i seriously doubt it was the best
why are you looking at crappy sitcoms?
sticks and stones may break my bones but they caused irreparable damage to my brain as an infant leading me to a life of constant child-like behavior
no need
time to shake it up a little
i mean i've said oh dear 63 times
i was just changing it up a bit
i even highlighted it for you
**o**__d__**h**__e__**o**__a__**h**__r__
that doesnt have a horrible, genetically inherited, incredibly rare bone disease
he's a popular man
sticks and stones will always break my bones due to my horrible, genetically inherited, and incredibly rare bone disease
what kind?
sticks and stones may break my bones but my small polio legs twitch occasionally
weeg
cue me dying now
no one will ever surpass me
that is right
sticks and stones may break my bones but *they will never hurt me as much as my son dying did*
*oh dear*
sticks and stones may break my bones but ***the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell***
or better yet
sticks and stones may break my bones but an asteroid twice the size of Mt. Everest would end humanity as we know it
what is that monster
'disgusted'
she seems
well, Ilsa isn't responding to my moves
once my character inevitably snaps he will talk to it
it is done
alrighty
why exactly?
oh also i inherited the skull
just for the giggles
exactly
but she's like forty and past child bearing age
if she was younger it would be strategic
its just for the laughs
by now im not even doing it because its strategic
so instead i have to settle for seducing my sister
cause my son aint gay
well there wont be a next time
i was chasing him but he was off fighting wars
i died before i could do that
but sadly all i got to do was feel relief
i was having plans of a collection of skulls
i thought i got the event to steal the head of my rival (my father) and i was happy a moment
bye?
bye
byeee
you are a freaking mad man
HURRAH
THE CHILD IS DEAD
IM GONNA THROW A FIVE YEAR OLD OFF A BALCONY
im trying to seduce the man AND kill my grandson
well im kind of multitasking here
im having plenty of fun
you havent played it fool
no?
its a very time consuming business really
places
situations
i have to choose the right times,
yeah
im a little busy trying to seduce a gay king so i cant play
WOAH BEN
WE DONT TOLERATE THAT LANGUAGE IN THIS SERVER
he's been hiding from my family for the past decade
my father said he would play hide and seek with me
***w o a h***
***w h a t***
weeg
i know but im reinterpreting it
octopus fighting
right
stop there
god no
"A 70-gallon tank—which is not an unusual choice for octopus enthusiasts wanting to provide their pet with plenty of room to roam—costs about $300"
"Prices range from $20 to $1,000"
i think so
its freaking adorable
i know

***HOW DO YOU KNOW?***
***YOU MUST ANSWER ME***
***HOW DO YOU KNOW***
***I"VE TOLD NO ONE ABOUT MY EMERGENCY NOSE REMOVAL SURGERY I GOT TODAY***
***i smell lies***
she must not have much power if i dont know about her but alright
i think it was about jenna marbles at least
i know nothing about jenna marbles except that nerdcubed made the same joke about her constantly during the same video series
Al-Gorithm
that made me laugh a little too hard
"The Democratic Republic of Youtubia, ruled by the dictator Al-Gorithm."
you must be insane
if thats the last image i see before dying then i dont want to die
science: complicated reductionism
***VORE IT***
you have an obsession
magic
gluten tagg
bye
that sounds more scary than glorious
what do you mean by 'glorious'
it really does sound like one
w o w
wow
yeah probably
thats just called mouse sensitivity ben
***PeAseAnAT***
but what emotion
sounds broken
exactly
of course
w h y d o e s t h i s h a v e 4 m i l l i o n v i e w s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6q5_7fVjEg
also
that sounds useful
sure
right
i hope troom troom burns
i have stated before that she annoys the heck out of me
it was a compliment
no reason to murder
a little protective there jacob
in many, many ways
i dont think she's you
she's an obnoxious, overly emotional, **nine year old**
she really shouldnt be
"loser"
her only reaction was to say
i just ran at my sister wielding a cane in one hand, and chip back in the other, all while screaming REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
at least there wouldnt be any conflict in that way
nah herding jacobs would be easy cause all of you would think the same
so a bit worse than herding cats
yeah
i mean by now i've accepted going anywhere requires the experience of basically herding cats
someone would drown
i dont believe i have the powers to do such a marvelous thing
i wanna read a book on the beach all of a sudden
i think they are just frozen water cubes
frick i ate all my icecubes
well its suicide so can we get half credit?
icecubes arent the best way to go out
so take that into account
so those icecubes are gonna have a lot of time to melt
the fastest a human can die from lack of air is three minutes
like i have no clue
take a bucket just in case
i dont want to know
i dont care
you know what
***w h a t***
***shelby that is why***
b!define duly
i do that all the time
**but why duly**
like i understand if its noted
why duly
why is that duly noted
probably
that would end you
that
an icecube's worth of water isnt going to drown you
then your not gonna end up dying
then yeah choking
i mean if it stays an icecube
probably choking
w o a h
i almost freaking choked on an icecube again
i simply couldnt contain myself clearly
i was dying from laughter as i typed that
woah you get the joke i made
the stars aligned
it just works better with tres
not 9
well that doesnt change the fact that 6 and 9 are multiples of tres
that sounds like more of a tres thing
that doesnt make much sense for a game called dos
i looked on the box and it says it conforms to the safety requirements of ASTM F963
but if you have a numbered card that is one of the factors of the card in question you can play
you see you can play the basic matching numbers and colors
they just get progressively more complicated
they need to finish the trilogy
i dont know but im waiting with anticipation
its a literal sequel
i know
and thats only because my mom just handed me the box
i just figured out it actually existed

i like
well im a rebel
also you like uno
the not so happy camp
right
terraria is odd
something tells me that wouldnt work
g o o d ?
i d o n t u n d e r s t a n d
no?
woah i dont feel like dying anymore hurrah
nah im just taking a shower
thats a good one
i ran out
another word starting with C
cry
contemplate
i dont know
anyways im going to go to a corner and
bap
it is done
boop
ill name the category to lung cancer
w h a t d o y o u n e e d
im hating this server more and more as time progresses
thats odd
why
ohno

this is my favorite

the evidence points to yes





there is something confusing me quite a bit
i should stop
im dying from laughter but afterwards i feel even more like i want to die
e x a c t l y
erm
obviously
you can see the change in my random videos so yeah playlist
ive been watching only the best content lately
***i dont know but im scared***
*end me*
in my recommended
oh yeah i saw that video as well
and dies
passes out
sits down to maximize surprise

good job
when you wake up and then start vomiting violently for no discernable reason
I thought all of you died at the same time
my god someone is alive
that's all folks

let me add:
amazing conversation to come back to
yup
he's not the butler
fine
frankly he likes the clothing that comes with it
what's wrong with being a butler
and he's really devoted to you
but somehow he can breath on land
he can't speak
like he is still a octopus
imagine him
an octopus butler
you know what I would invest in?
well its cancer so things will be ruined literally all the time
ah
where is the comma placed
watching these barbaric, primitive, "conversations" unfold is actually pretty interesting
indeed
wo a g
the majority is against you jabob
goodnoot
alrighty
alrighty?
erm
you know i'll have to mute you if you continue to spam
are you finished?
shelby im going to have to ask you to stop
i dont like the devolution here
its mcafee
first of all you dingos
and soda is genuinely unhealthy
its great
no human thinks that mac and cheese is bad
call him Mr. Cheese
***why cheese but not in a bad kind of why***
name him something really cheesy too
**yess**
that sounds cool
i want a pet baby octopus
i dont think you should immediately turn to suicide just cause you spelled something wrong
octopi
its like herding cats
can you guys cooperate on anything?
you probably shouldnt confess to a murder on something like this
this is so entertaining
good job guys at somehow messing up the simplest game imaginable
*ohdear*
but the video is so much better
this is excessive winking
my computer is freaking exploding
have a lovely time everyone
yeah same
not speaking would be the best course of action
good job on taking the compliment
yes
humanity only makes the best
i think that mr. crow over here is more accurate

"Then He woke up from the delusions He was under, and He SMITETH all the freaks He cursed upon the new land. And God saw that it was *now* good."
weeg
"God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good." - Genesis 1:25
i dont care
***and the bird***
how the words dance together at the same beat
the elegance
the poetry
its freaking beautiful
i know
woah indeed


my god
maybe
sadly there arent many pictures
***a different kind of feet***
(breathes)

they do but
***birds with feet***
(breathes)
you know how there is a bird with arms subreddit?
also that gives me an excellent idea mr. crow
good job
***typing***
(breathes)
then how are you
woah
crow or not you could still have them
***mind powers***
(breathes)
shelby have you even tested if you have any
also

would it be discrimination if i renamed the role to weeb?
***mind powers***
(breathes)
are you sure you dont have any
ripperoni

i dunno
then stop waiting and
also maybe i should stop getting distracted
maybe you should stop trying so hard
thats sad
a single tear runs down their cheek
and its ***BERTHA***

w h a t
do we get discounts?
oh nice
something really stupid like that would definitely happen
break holes in the walls frantically trying to escape the madness
watch us somehow manage to destroy half of it
an escape room would be interesting to say the least
you dont say
oh jesus ziplining?
thats fine
i m s c a r e d
m y g o d
what else could they name it
of course
empire of ikea
same game company as the one who made ck2
there is eu4 for that though
this game sadly ends before the reformation
freaking pagans are gonna be every where
plus the viking age literally just started so everything will become much, much worse
so the papacy is at war with duke theoderic the previous ruler of austrasia before he was booted
and the pope isnt too happy with that
he is claiming to be the real pope
no he is just an opposing pope that was set up
there is some drama between the pope in rome and the antipope somewhere in france
which is karling controlled by the way
im leaving out some of the wars with italy
also because it would be too much
kind of because i dont know it all, i cant im not omnipotent
also by the way im simplifying the history A LOT
so god dang it i will try till i die
and im really persistent
im gay
the karling in power there is gay
which is where it comes back to me
anyways now the karlings are back in power in austrasia
i think its from a holy war
dont ask why germany owns a bit of northern spain
king theoderic the bewitched was cool with it though
some weird stuff happened and now the roddings own it
by the way the kingdom of france is kind of just there

ill send a screenshot
king theoderic the second was overthrown in austrasia
king neibelung rules aquitaine to the south
thats where im at
the kingdom of germany
king teudoin the priest hater rules to the east
right now two kingdoms are ruled by the nibelunging family
one died before his father
some just werent all too greedy
which is why its split between three kingdoms
fighty
what kind of happened is they got a bit
well
he had five sons
until he died
king theoderic the bewitched was a fine
then the nibelunings who ruled fairly well
then merohingi for the infection wound guy and his murdered son
yes
karling
and now nibelungings
merohingi
karlings
i've named the three
they inherited after the boy died
because of weird dynasty relations
thats where the nibelungings come in
yes
died under mysterious circumstances*
im sorry
before he was murdered*
he didnt have much time to prove himself
so he kind of left the kingdom to his nine year old kid
before he got an infected wound and died at 34
the dude was alright
so they installed theoderic the fourth from the merohingi dynasty
his vassals didnt like him though
before they died of course
the current situation is essentially the karling ruled france was screwed over cause the karling king decided he had a lot of fun torturing his prisoners, which didnt exactly make him all too liked
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrasia
and yes that makes austrasia a real territory as well
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungids
and the nibelungings were a real cadet branch of the karlings
the merohingi were a real dyansty with frankish descent
they ruled the empire of francia and many more kingdoms
so the karlings were real
from then the ai does stupid stuff and messes up the course of history
there are start dates, where all the characters, settings, dynasties, are real
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merovingian_dynasty
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_dynasty
its 801 its early germanic gus
but you can google them
thats probably why
well they are of germanic descent
all of which have ruled france at some time with the last thirty years
the karlings, the merohingi, and the nibelunging
there have been like three ruling dynasties going at it
not just one leader
one of which is named germany
its split into four kingdoms right now
yeah pretty much
i swear there has been at least seven different civil wars in twenty years
and im not entirely sure what is happening
the political situation in france is very complicated right now
yes
king chlothar the fourth of austrasia is gay
my god this is magical
fair enough point
im not a cannibal
i wont need luck, he's like four it should be really easy
time for the grandson now
fancy
via snake
it was my son's wife
i guess i could count the unborn baby
I JUST KILLED A PREGNANT WOMAN OH GOD
well they must be very smol grenades
i dont know
im playing ck2
i think im spiraling
and i kind of made him a bit screwed up from the beginning
i think about what the character would actually do
but im just going with the flow from there
well i did make him
he wouldnt have died so fast from cancer otherwise
be the constant target of murder plots tends to make you a bit stressed and depressed which lowers health
i claim partial credit
honestly i didnt care whether i was the one to kill him or cancer
then he got cancer and died at like 23
for almost the dude's entire life i was trying to kill him
i indirectly killed a count
i think
but both were strategic
and some random girl i cant remember
his duke
i swear its a strategic decision
his grandson and his son's wife
right now he is working on two more
yeah, he's killed two people
he is kinda screwed up
"i dont blame them"
when hearing about a murder plot with the target being his only son he said, and i quote,
**a lot**
like
my character hates his children
apparently it was
i was going to respond to you as well
also you dont have to delete shelby
do you even know what civilization looks like


yes
with a blade?
there was also a chance of me getting caught
i freaking cut it off
indeed
**i will get the last laugh**
but nah
i had the option to lay my rivalry to rest
but there was an event chain anyways
so i dont know how i got to the body
she died from dysentery while somewhere in greece at the very young age of 17
along with the finger of st. john
like i just have it in my treasury
just keep it on the mantlepiece apparently
i had no idea my character was capable of such amazing things
i just stole the skull of my 17 year old dead daughter
28533
I think we have a majority
there we go
is troom troom really better than dogs?
you fake
I take this as you not liking dogs
most things in fact
many things can
what do you mean I don't
I REIGN VICTORIOUS ONCE AGAIN
HAHA
and something tells me we are watching something better
something tells me I did
sure

https://www.fandom.com/articles/thor-buzz-lightyear-quiz
but how did i get to this place
sorry to break the flow of the ideas in the conversation
most are
its not the worst movie to be obsessed with
i mean rapunzel is a good movie
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
i mean tangled is alright but im not gonna go out of my way to watch it
jesus christ
download it illegally
im impressed
that is a somewhat acceptable favorite movie
same
r i g h t
wow
thats
im assuming dumbo
the birds or dumbo?
just cause you used to be scared of a scene doesnt make it a bad movie
what do you mean 'ew'?
that was a bit racist
there were the crows
96% from metacritic
97% from rotten tomatoes
but it was still a good movie from what i remember
that was a thing that happened wasnt it?
one of the classic disney movies?
snow buddies has a 5.4/10 from IMDb
childhood
right
also puppies freaking died during the production of snow buddies
because i like watching good movies that how
i havent watched any of those kinds of movies
weeg
because that makes my brain realize 'oh shoot thats messed up'
if i was just looking at pictures of dead puppies it would make it less funny
personally that would make it funnier for me
oh also im sick in the head
***ha word jokes***
its a bit blunt
killing anything with a bat can be funny
i may or may not have laughed
it caught me a bit off guard

and
for the argument i googled man killed by puppies for an example
also
alrighty
BUT YOU YELLED RIGHT BACk
I TRIED TO CALM DOWN
BECAUSE YOU ARE
I DONT CARE ANYMORE
YOU SHOULDNT
if you die from a puppy overdose thats your problem not mine
fine
IM BLIND IN MY RIGHT EYE
NO I CANT
just BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD EXTERIOR MEANS NOTHING ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF IT
i gotta get some water for this popcorn wait a momento

Woah
*discord first messages*
this is the high I live for
this
none of those awards from last year
screw that top dragon bullcarp
I know
first one to March 23rd boiiii
and aha
holi pepperoni I'm alive again
goodbye
and yet someone still doesn't have a ko-kaiser role
we have argued long enough
we've already decided
anyways I'm done with this
that's why I told you just now
I mentioned my own thoughts during the discussion before the vote
you don't have a clean record
I was talking about before
you aren't
sorry?
I muted you for spamming because you were
you didn't have to get muted several times to get that message count
you weren't that smart about it then
accept it
they voted against you
I held a vote
it's an honorary title on discord
why do you care so much as to argue about it this much?
also if you don't mind me asking
which you wouldn't if you were just ko-kaiser
they were worried about unfair position hopping
**he's just ben gus**
yeah
what could Ben have against you?
I'm not part of the council
yes
well what I want is to have certain decisions voted upon by the kewl kids klub
I'm saying as a counter argument to your whole speech about how actual power structures that I know how I want to run the server better than you do
that's a bit of a straw man
I'm not saying I'm running it better
dude
what?
I was saying I think I know how I want to run this server better than you do
I think I know how I want to run my server Gus
this is discord, and we have our own power structures that don't have to comply to your stereotypical model
but the flaw was already pointed out
well it's what your saying, just more direct and less exampley
you are saying that our process is invalid because it doesn't comply to stereotypical decisions real life power structures make when promoting
I don't need a million examples
I get what you are saying
heck kaiser means king in german
really it doesn't make much sense upon closer inspection
haha
I'm a military dictator
it's more so a joke if you don't get it
do you want the roles here explained gus?
okay?
yes I'm aware
in fact it's kind of stupid to have a government system thats meant for a large amount of people implemented with like barely over 10
who said my discord has to follow the rules and regulations of our country
yeah I was about to say
I don't think I need it explained to me
I don't know military structure and command but I feel like I maybe get your point you are trying to make and you don't have to make it twice
well in America the vice president is chosen because they are the running mate to the president
make it three hours
but you need to keep going
I wish it was
but what did you want to discuss
they have the most amazing alcohol
really quite nice
I know right
byeee
oh also im still omnipotent so i can tell when someone messes up
goodbye
dont let this devolve to spamming
also moderators you should know what to do
you can if you want to, but dont blame me when you are interrupted
try not to spam
im going to disappear for a little
obviously
that is funny
ah
what is it?
hm?
im going to disappear and nurse my headache
you all can scream your hearts content in cancer
its kind of sad, i like this friend group but jesus
yeah
its because of impatience, people slightly angery, and not knowing dignity or basic politeness
my good, clear mood has been kind of ruined
i was going to make a timeline but i've got nothing finished
you have some problems and frankly i have a headache
done
ben't and BaJimBa both voted nay
also i didnt vote
hence the 2-0 vote
Shelby L refused to vote
the vote for the Promotion of Gus to Ko-Kaiser concludes with a 2-0 vote in favor of nay
let me finish
stop typing ben
the verdict has been concluded
it does
we are discussing the request as you speak
if you really want to argue about this while im trying to work then the kewl kids klub and i can have a discussion about this
so dont worry about that
well he isnt apparently
then you arent getting any other title gus
gus you are next up for the kewl kids klub once we add someone else to it
first of all its mah kitchen boi
you do realize an honorary title is an award of sorts?
gus im not going to give you anything right now mostly because you seem incapable of listening to me at some times, even if im being serious and laying out what you should and shouldnt do.
alrighty thancc
does anyone know around what time the server was created
they dont
thanks for answering for me
~~that do barely anything~~
they are my group of moderators
and by all means the kewl kids klub have power as well
i dont actually strip you guys of that many freedoms
nothing has fallen apart
this one is working well
there's also going to be recordings of my rule and the governments i tried to put in place
weeg
i need to record all major historical events
of the chat
just as long as its made
it doesnt matter much
do any one you really want to
im working on the timeline now
e x a c t l y
indeed
**i should add a thancc bot**
yeah i had the same thoughts

you probably do
I do not watch netflix that often
I don't understand how you could do that
usually I try to rewatch a show but get distracted and stop after a few episodes
concerning

shelby

I was afraid of this happening
I'm not gonna watch season 2
I wish it didn't
magic
nah that's just that
why must everything I love be ruined
well screw them

I think I have a problem and netflix is trying to point it out to me
British Movies & TV
below romantic tv shows is
I have no clue
TV Shows set in London
right there
below it is romantic TV shows
like right above it is emotional TV shows
do I really watch enough TV Shows set in London to get that exact category at my home screen on Netflix
yeah
I uh

https://www.godaddy.com/garage/how-to-make-a-minecraft-server/
at least it would be some time
not the people who would grief though
nah not everyone would go to such measures as to obtain a bucket just for that
but still a bit cancer inducing
maybe a little fun
slightly less cancerous
alright
creative or survival?
wait a moment
***cancer***
i dont think you understand
ill make one comment on the idea of a giant minecraft server: that would be pure cancer
*my god*
*a wii party*
the one thing that bugs me is that its too religious for an outspoken athiest, but it is a burial in westminster
beneficial cucumber was at his memorial service
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIytlzCPfaE
right
i want to see him alive
you all are talking about your second time around consecutively
right after the other one
but like you just took the quiz
you all dont have that good of short term memory
***yA y?***
yay
right
it
stop
well then
a 5% improvement is good especially since its been a month
47 to 77 to 82 are your beginning scores so far
alrighty
anyways ill be tracking your progress over the course of the months
it took me like two minutes though
i got a one hundred when i tried it before i sent it to shelby
good job
there will be a next time
77 to 82
so i dont care
well that was your first score you told me last time
last time i yelled surprise test you got a 77
what was last time?
wait a moment 82?
i dont think that would work out all too well
yeah but that would kind of destroy the current government we have
quite a few look similar
but there are a lot of states
i dont know
alrighty
tell me your first score
that makes more sense
ohhhhhh
how
whats the difference?
either one
https://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3003
pop quiz
also you shouldve seen this coming shelby
yup
good job
wyatt is in our fifth period
ignacio is in our flex shelby
god not ignacio too
wyatt smith makes me sick
i dont know what actually pay attention to countries means but ill take it
ill take it as a compliment though
civility ben, civility
my third try i got 100% in 38 seconds m8
while real issues are ignored
radicalism is on the rise
you can see it affecting bipartisanship in america today
the natural tendency for humans to thoughtlessly align themselves with a group and go with it until its too late
its this tribalistic behavior that will be the downfall of humanity
good job and maintaining individuality and standing out from the masses
there was no fairness there
you spoke out against my country in geography out of spite and not objectivity
advocate for fairness?
anyways
its messed up
and the panhandle actually crosses across like ten ethnic groups
i also remember namibia because it was one of the few german colonies in africa
zambia looks like two countries merged
namibia is the panhandle boi
also
you spoke out against my country in geography out of spite and not objectivity
i never knew you'd be so against adding a tally mark to your side based off of a practice score
without capitals it makes more sense
okay
that is such a confusing sentence
why the question marks
ill add a tally mark
i got a 77% my first try
what about a comatose child?
is it a map quiz?
ah shoot son
holi crap there is a geography test tomorrow
byee
all of the above

can one get their bellybutton removed?
***ZOO WEE MAMA***
burst into the room while screaming
i mean how many people has this darn ploopy killed
manny is responsible for most terrorist attacks
boys will be boys
my mind instantly made the connection
thats all i could think about in geography by the way when she mentioned it
indeed he is
wasnt manny also responsible for the rwandan genocide
you are sick
im picturing that and oh jesus
i havent even thought of that
ewww
what does this have to do with it

what the crap
and
greg egg
i looked up
thats why i searched up more pictures
yeah same
in the egg himself
gregg is real ladies and gentlemen

forcefully
he's just looking out for the kid
like a loving father would
his flaw just happens to be he goes into an alcohol fueled fit of anger and he takes it out violently upon his family
our own flaws
we all have our darksides
thats why i said occasionally
i thought child abuse was wrong
only occasionally does he partake in the recreational sport of **beating his wife and children**
indeed

***i am incapable of understanding the question***
***i dont get the question***
wasnt susan and rowley's dad a thing too?
also
i definitely remember that one

i like this moment in their wacky history
indeed
im not surprised
but also just an example of the eccentric, quirky, adorable antics of the family
that was terrifying
like that one time manny got cooked into the thanksgiving turkey
those rascals
always getting into a bit of trouble
oh the heffleys
of course you are
its just a measly 51 seconds
why wouldnt you watch it
a surprisingly pure one
nah its just something i came across on reddit
i only just realized a few seconds after i sent it that i sent it
i thought thats what you would think
i mean at the end they dont end up slaughtering each other
yes?
indeed you could, build a little shrine
https://external-preview.redd.it/mp4/QhVze9hkrTd9kxexULNb1mx9EMNEEnjkLX_89L_4DUI-source.mp4?s=61961c0fcae4b7ca8d325d175732be149f35f653
also
right
images shouldnt be confusing
its a literal image ben
which part is confusing
***are you incapable of seeing***
**what do you mean**
what do you mean

stabbed him twenty eight times in the throat
you just slip up and oops
it just happened
whoopsies
***o H dE Ar***
this story
like
the minor details keeps you going
no dont
get the will to live then
oh dear
weeg
also i wasnt born in mexico?
also i think you mean mexico?
sombrero land i think you mean?
IM SORRY BUT ARE YOU ASSUMING GENDER
which i why i used they
it can be used singularly
they can refer to someone as a human
you racist

and i have given up on my mission
whats wrong with you
excuses
thats my daily average
you got just over 300
weakling
ohhhhh
you should know
you are you
i mean
i dont know
r i g h t
definitely different from today
yeah i know
thats the pie chart from the first day, the message and all

i have made a pie chart based off of the very first day from 12/12
and in honor of this being the chat's 100th day anniversary

woag guys i got some new graphs
eat mercury
just make him sick
also bye
you are one year closer to death
hurrah
and good morning
cue the borthday fireworks and the 100th day ones
also its the 100th day this chat has existed
habby borthbay bacob
ever
you read half a book every three years there is no way you would get to it
you don't have to consider reading it
nah it's fine
it's a good
I'm finished talking about my book now
and the pastor running the place mysteriously fell down stairs in just a way to fracture his skull and kill him in prison awaiting trial
the policeman Harriman died in a carriage accident while fleeing
However Lord Baron Blackwater or whatever blew his brains out with a gun
no one was tried for their crimes due to everyone being so high up
oh also not to ruin the cat but they had a room with a secret camera that took pictures to use as black mail later
goodnort
eyeheartbugs
aww
I didn't expect for Lords, Barons, Police Officers, Art Exhibitors, and a member of the royal family to go full pedo
I imagined a drug cartel wealthy politicians got rich off of
but jesus
like the slightly tied in mystery of the cairstair curse I got right
I have to say the only reason I didn't figure this one out at least a bit was because it was so appalling for a sherlock holmes novel
if you think pedophiles getting what they want fun, then yes
rent out the boys to particularly wealthy customers
uh
and they
which was ran by a pastor and his wife who also govern a boy's orphanage
after a second attempt on his and watsons life in a traveling circus they go to the house of silk
and he escaped prison
we're going to poison him with arsenic in his food in prison but sherlock is toosmart4u
they staged sally's fake murder
members of the house of silk set up a trap where holmes was forcefully injected with opium in a den
but yeah off topic
indeed
checkmate
but
fair play
it makes me hate every second of it
typing on this phone is a nightmare
I swear
I don't believe you
cause he doesn't exist fool
he doesn't
cool but it's faked
I was about to steal it
I hate this phone
oh c'mon
things like that
how often do you lactate Mr. DeVito?
or
can I have your hands, I need them for fuel
such as
just scream random incoherent things
Danny DeVito by your side through all of it
this dude gets it for free?
like I'm jealous
maybe I'll live in the crazy, only slightly illiterate, northern part
it's an amazing place
the more north you go the more south it gets
that tricked me for like a quarter of a second
a n g e r y?
woah
they are like magic to me
I don't know how crayons work
would the orange crayon turn the water orange as well?
I see a bird in that case
w h a t
also
**s p o n g g e**
this man is watching the
modern comedy is the best comedy

bye
oof
god's number
ew
obviously
yes it is
it's ruined now gus
but thanks for ruining my fun
well I was about to mess with him
so that is it?
are you concerned it would immediately turn into a cesspool of cancer? am I stupid for not picking up on your logic here
so wait a moment
anything would truly go ideally
yeah
get it shut down?
I'm assuming he means me? but that doesn't make much sense
what power
the hecc does that mean
why?
be free
it really wasn't that bad so
also gus I haven't set a timer I'm sorry
but you know what I mean
we have our own opinions
I really wish he'd actually take up the anything goes anime corner
but I'd really rather not have those *very questionable* pictures plastered every five messages
like I understand this is cancer
maybe
oh shoot son planny bois permissions weren't set up right
also if you can gus try messaging every channel
I'm really being serious about an anything goes anime corner
wait a momento
no just muted
gus
im always watching
but know
im actually going to leave momentarily now
weird
that part was
i know
dont do a stupid
im going to disappear momentarily
the gods took a lot of forms
an anime girl?
sorry about the anime picture plastered as soon as you got on
goodnoot
thats like reading the first page of genesis and claiming to be a theologian, ben
ben you dont even know what communism is
im sincerely sorry for assuming you have the lowest form of intelligence
you said you saw a bunch of colors and i responded appropriately
its a pie chart you fool
oh yeah this is sharing
if you couldnt tell by the graphs
but this still isnt communism
better
that
jesus
get it right
28*
so good luck on that one
im not planning on dying before the road trip
and not in a good way
you should know by now that i destroy people's expectations
vomit
cry
bleed
stare at the ceiling for hours
i dont know
i think im going to lay down for a little while and
e x a c t l y
there is also an edit function you can make use of so correcting in another line is pointless
at least try to look like your misspelling accidentally
there is a reason this is called cancer
im not keeping this
and also
to be fair i refrain from spamming and i know i can definitely control myself
i bypass everything
im the owner
i literally cant do anything about this
erm
as much as i'd like to use this
indeed
the point is to stop spamming along the lines of someone mashing their forehead into the keys then sending a new message every second
well why dont you look at that
where the frick is it
im gonna test something
not you
im aware
you really like skirting the line dont you?
you couldve sent that to me first
"Ahegao, also called O-Face also called "Oro-Face", is a term of Japanese pornography describing a facial expression of fictional characters during sex often used in pornographic videogames, manga and anime. Meanwhile, the Ahegao face became a fashion trend for erotic enthusiasts in Japan."
wait arent ahegao faces hentai or at least have very strong erotic connotations?
one was really sexually suggestive
dont send hentai
jesus
when was the last time something was posted on there
oh right isnt there that weeb server
are you sure you dont want a separate anime corner?
i placed the holy bible at the lorax's feet
but others might
i dont know anything else
something about pomegranates
barely
i told him "he speaks to, and for the trees which is witchcraft" and "he speaks to the dead now"
thats when i espoused wisdom onto him
"why the lorax?"
no?
"the lorax?" - me father
frick me dad is here
**HODOR**
weirdo
thanks for notifying me

biggestboibilly@gmail.com
if you have any complaints about my terrible decisions please contact me at
biggestboibilly
it was
oh sorry
i was under the email shrekdaddy
i never got a reply back
yeah
i tried to email it to him

here is a perfectly clear version
fine
indeed he did
i think you all can remember that a bit
but the first time i tied a noose was to hang the odd1sout doll
i dont know
oh well
yeah pretty much
but im lazy soooo
i genuinely tried to keep one so i can reflect better on my demeanor, actions, personality, etc.
no
wait a momento
actually i cant
wait a few moment because i can get you the exact date
and for the first time
same as they do now
i have a dreading feeling my dad actually occasionally gets concerned
'why cant he just tie sailor knots?'
my dad in response
'once you get home you'll see a surprise (the lorax hanging)'
'your son has been tying nooses again'
my mom is talking on the phone to my dad
i swear it sounds worse than it actually is
other than that i cant really tell any difference from normal
maybe a month ago or so
one time they told me not to kill myself
9 or 10
the last time they asked whether i was depressed was when i was like
**just one, i cant find anything else that works as well. i mean cords are really hard to tie**
i gave the actual answer of one
*how many nooses do we have in this house?*
then asked
well she gave an awkward sort of laugh
*oh my goddd*
she walked by the lorax a couple times, and all she said was
~~or just resting i dunno~~
currently in her bedroom drinking her sorrows away
oh she is here
thank god my dad isnt back home yet
do you think there is fanfiction of the lorax but he is a classic horror movie villain
***thou who are unholy shall have the consequences***

**it was what we had to do**
**speaking to trees, and for trees is witchcraft**
**he must pay for his sins**

ill get closer
see it now?

ill give a closer look
see the thing that doesnt belong?


here is as if you are walking into my house
i got a few more pictures to send
e f e
but yes
yOuR sPesSSHaL
at a home environment
thats my sister
thats errr
i know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiJioeFZSzc&feature=youtu.be
perfect timing
but also talking about recording things hanging
jocum is definitely wrong in more ways than one
i will
she was reading it in a southern accent
it was a holy experience
she read like a quarter of the first page of genesis
whom i hung
my sister is now reading the bible to the lorax
im not
frickity frackity i need some sticky notes for that
i should really streamline this process
bye
its fine
wouldve been better that way
i shouldnt have said anything
this is way too much effort for 15 seconds
IM TRYING HARDER BUT IT DOESNT WORK FASTER
FRICKITY FRACKITY
frick
bye
alrighty
its also taking a while since im getting distracted
relax
but sit back
this is gonna take a while
bye
god dang it why is this so difficult
I'm confused
wait a beautiful second
i got it
imagine this with the hands
i need it as a prop again
or im just mentally retarded
i think i have hand coordination problems
GOD DANG IT
so now i need to clear my search history
i somehow have managed to forget
i got a bit preoccupied with retying a noose
oh crap son i entirely forgot about the comments i wanted to make on the situation
sorry (i also seem to be slightly confused)
mcgraw hill science something something stuff stuff
i have no clue

good job
your welcome
8. The spreading can push rock and move continental crust
7. The older crust is farther from the ridge, the younger is closer
6. They can use an echo sounder
5. Because they are pushed away from it after it solidifies
4. A. At mid-ocean ridges
thank you
if you say slut one more time i swear to god i will stop giving answers now
3. Mid-ocean ridges form from lava pushing through the crust and seafloor spreading
2. Draw a diagram of seafloor spreading
1. As lava from the core comes up and solidifies, the magnetic orientation is the same as it was when it erupted
reword the following then
do you just straight up want the answers?
why must you deprive me of such basic things
all i wanted to do was note on how i always thought gus had a mental illness
im seriously about to snap my own spine
no
yup
so
well he told us that
it twas all homework
yes
hm?
i take a minutes silence as victory
same back at you, schizo maniac
thats against it
thats the opposite of defense
that doesnt sound all too welcoming
i didnt expect a straight answer either
gus?
why have a feral one around, its suicide thats what
even a tame one could snap at any moment and rip half your face off with one swipe
its like having a feral bear around
that seems dangerous
cant you control your gus?
they deserve it
good
unleash him upon them
there you go
and freaking kill them
harness that fear
dont be scared
welwonks
beat the person watching fortnite over the head with an instrument
now
(reword some of them obviously)
(7. deep-ocean trenches)
(5. Subduction, because the oceanic crust is being pushed, and it starts sinking below into underwater canyons)
(4. 3. Scientists measured and there is more thermal energy being released under mid-ocean ridges)
(4. 2. These bands also have similar age, composition, ect.)
(4. 1. The bands of rocks with a specific magnetic orientation)
(3. Old oceanic crust is pushed away from the mid-ocean ridge.)
the hecc.
what do you have so far then
at least try to answer some of them before asking for answers

i would take the job if i had the chance to, as long as im compensated for my time monetarily
it depends on whether you test it on yourself
i dont know

you know what gives me the will to live
i heard it can hurt
dont do that
oh deAr
yeah
it
that
its had such an impact on society by now
the scary part is that it will probably be in some history book
its mandated by the future education system
yes
and they will be *very confused*
that will be dug up by alien archeologist
and humanity has wiped itself off the face of the earth
once the nuclear holocaust comes about
i know

I just realized I never asked you what your thoughts were on the Last Crusade

woah I'm back

for only the sneakiest of sneakers
it's called incognito mode
I'm already on it
oh jesus
but I've said enough I feel
I don't like that oh yeah
but do you think in one he like *shoots* web ya know
I have no clue
no
that's
since you think you know
what exactly do you think I'm trying to say
well
well
I'm sorry
um

do you think there's a spiderman fanfic where
spierman
now
kill me
i
t h a n k s b r a i n

holy carp spiderman fan fiction can be *really* erotic
that was impulsive
I'm sorry
do you think he uses the webs to spice things up?
now I'll never be able to disconnect the information in my brain
well
the hell why do I need this info on waluigi
he isn't wearing the right foot wear
that's appalling
WOW
alrighty
ah
ear aids?
all I hear is lies
he was a freak
I know my arm fires
that's right
all 72 from one of them shotgunns

that's honestly amazing
***my god***
*but were those*
but
it was buried fast but
sorry
*just put him back in for a few more weeks*
he wasn't ready yet
they should've put him back in
*can you abort ten year old child*
I know for a fact there must be somewhere a mother furiously googling
"***put him back in please***"
by the way
right
I didn't know there was two
ooOooOh
by cool
unlikely
interesting stuff
a possible alien dyson swarm
weeg
and usually we find planets this way, light blocked from a star by a planet
it's very inconsistent
they are, in fact there is a star, I don't remember the name of it, but it has an irregular light pattern
why?
dyson spheres?
also yes
blood cells that just made a bit of a mistake is the most british way you could've described cancer
WoW
(not this one)
cancer beaten to a bloody pulp
world hunger solved
everything is resolved
well then that's nice
alrighty
oh
and what are you confuzzled about m8
vowels
an argument*
also
you could've been spacing out the answer from the rest of the sentence there
I thought you like died mid way through typing
that makes more sense
OHHHHHH
"what cabin are you in and I got" - gus
I think you are having a stroke
first of all
sorry?

good sleep ben't
memorization
thats all school is
it's called superior memory based solely off of good genetics and luckiness
actually I do know
I don't know
I'm just kinda taking things as they come
I have to be honest I have no idea what is going on in school
it's gus shelby
you should be
yeah
r i g h t
but we do want you to stop talking
no one is victim shaming you
rammed is not a good choice of word
also
~~boop~~
it's the squiggles
*you incredibly intelligent human being*
~~you fool~~
but for now
if it actually gets confusing I'll change mine a bit
*I love it so much*
yeah but did you see the straight line of just Jim faces
why does the actual meaningful stuff pass right by me
a bit late but all Jim pictures are accepted

also
if you spammed i would freaking smite you
thats a good decision
so if you dont have everything cut out you should do that
we will have 15 minutes or so to work on it in class tomorrow
i would choose bottom right hand corner cause thats what my gut is telling me
any of the corners can do
weeg
bottom right hand corner i would say
hm?
that makes sense
you all are vomiting right, left, and center
jesus christ, i only vomit when sick
you didnt eat freaking six cakes in ten minutes jacob
but have you ever eaten six of them in a row?
im pretty sure he already has is the sad part
jesus christ
and disappoint me
you make no sense
its funny ideoso
why would you want out of that?
its beautiful
in* i think you mean
**i want die**
good old
ah
it gives me life
i feed off of roblox
yup
but that looks right
i probably need to cut it all out
i forgot about it
weeg
erm
what is it?
hm?
eating is overrated
https://imgur.com/gallery/z5bo2Ws
good decision
i see all
you are right gus, im omnipotent
im exist
***s e x i s t***
personally i dont mind if he shoots up the school
its easier to see the classes there
its a nice graph

bam
but
alrighty
welp i got a new graph im really excited about
thats good
try again until you give up
aw
alrighty
bamboozled
***ha***
and this is how i spend it
i actually just have this much free time
the sad part is i dont try to be active
yeah
its called Message Disparity
yeah
thats a good idea
not including today
96 days
84
woag my average is 311 messages a day
byee
i remember now
ohhh
where did you get that from
you found my cult picture
also
weeg
its 84
thats what she did and what i did
no its right
i average between 200 and 400 messages a day
well if you look at the numbers, at least the January ones
*everyday*
885 messages
"Okie doki yello" - the first words
12/12/18
or that
remember a message that came from the beginning
yup
im loving these metaphors
and people pretty much stay in their own categories
the two largest jumps are 2nd and 3rd and 5th and 6th
i havent thought of that
that is true
BaJimBa?
but
sorry to overlook the stats for a moment
erm
im using the stats from my pie chart not the current server
about 7,826
***calculation intensifies***
making the average number of messages
and then three who each have below two hundred
below four thousand each
there are the three lower middle classes
over five thousand at least
there is the higher kinda middle class
tens of thousands
the top two
the top 18% are responsible for 66.2% of the server's messages
or if you wanna put it in the documentary terms
we are responsible for 66.2% of the message shelby
but yeah
welp he dead
yeah
b!insult tim
who is active, super active, and inactive
yeah its pretty obvious to tell who is who on that scale
WOAG
this is what true inequality looks like
the top 45% of this server are responsible for 96.5% of the server's messages
of course there is
i sent jimmygaming420 the invite*
i sent you the invite
hacker man
its ben
ben
jesus
"im going to shoot you- " - mr. beyl
thats true

the message disparities that are plaguing Shelby is Big Gay, Both of Them
to represent the message disparities here
wait a moment i got a slightly up to date pie chart
fair enough
oh god
yes
*here you see this spike was because of the Little Pig Boy Epidemic*
there are like landmarks so people have a general feel when things happen
i think we should make a documentary about the message disparity on this discord
sounds doable
also i just reached for my cheeseburger and it was gone and i am sad
w o a h
fat cushion
but hey
you cant go many places
i mean you'd have a cushion where ever you went
i mean it sounds lovely
maybe just maybe i want to be so fat i am immobilized
yeah
maybe i want to just randomly clutch at my stomach and then die in school
maybe i wanna die of a heart attack at 50
screw that stuff
i know
haha i am consistently unhealthy
i have like nearly 30k total messages
what the hecc is that big spike
terrifying
cause apparently i actually dont have anything better to do with my time
also im going through every month and everyone one by one to actually get accurate info that stat bot no longer provides
***indeed***
there's nothing i love more than a reheated mcdonald's cheeseburger

12 years
she has been alive a long time
she's snoring louder now that she's gone to sleep
weeg
it's just easier to show love I suppose
weeg
I have shown Charlotte more love than I ever have to every human I know combined
as much as I criticize people for showing more affection for their pets than their fellow human
odd...
that's terrible
ohno
I shined my phone light over and she was going after her tail
*oh shoot*
and I was like
like she's snoring and then I heard sudden movement
I am
I thought Charlotte was having a seizure but she's just attacking her own tail

I expect nothing less

I'm going to delete it now
your still the one who did it

don't post particularly sexually suggestive images
there are still rules on what you can post
gus
but by now I doubt that matters
yeah
well
it seems even more illegal if you are finishing your will after your dead
I signed it like five times, that should count
where do we even hold the funeral
in the will and everything
that's true
woah
boo
because I'm a ghost
have you even tasted eye milk
I mean c'mon

***I can max give you a year in prison***
***it's a misdemeanor***
if you repeatedly abused a pet, or killed it, then I would give you jail time
Due to your negligence you severely wounded a pet, so you stay away from animals and probation just to be safe this isn't the beginning of erratic and neurotic behavior
and I gave you punishment
malice intent is the difference from voluntary manslaughter and first degree murder
did you have malice intent
how badly did you hurt the llama
how often did you hurt the llama
it's not that bad a misdemeanor
alrighty

AAAAAH
it'll take some time so wait quite a few hours
calm down I'm working on it
but I'm working on it
that would be defeating the whole point
ill put you on trial for both involuntary manslaughter and animal abuse in no time
so don't worry ma'am
and I'm going to study up on law
I'm going to make a separate court server

i know its asking for a lot
i want to be buried with exactly four cheerios
I gotta go
I don't think you can have it as a pet
well it's an endangered species
they are so precious
they don't deserve this

have you seen kiwis?
land of the kiwi man
I have one last comment on the terrorist attack
exactly
*what did new zealand do to anyone?*
but my question is
49 dead
New Zealand was attacked in a terrorist attack
exactly
boiiiiiiii
good morning
I applaud once, very softly to show I have been out applauded
I applaud back so hard my hands turn freaking purple
I applaud thee applauding me as a sign of thankk for the applause
and I couldn't be more thankful
it's been reached
finally
finally...
after so long a time dedicated to this
but finally here I am
people lived and died
the time all blurred together to where the sun was just a streak across the sky
day and then night and day again
I worked tirelessly
I wanted to make a smooth transition over to the cancer channel from the word-music one
ever since I was little
I will
myself
and most importantly
my pet plant named david
my mom
I'd like to thank my dad
I spent a lot of time thinking and deciding
I worked hard on it
* insert smooth transition into this chat here *
fair enough
just because it works doesn't mean it's the best, or even preferable, solution
that makes about as much sense as fighting fire with fire
block out a negative emotion with a negative one?
my eye is stuck under a tight spot somehow
my finger is over there
and then my brains are there
poof
like just
I would've exploded
I wouldn't have been able to handle that
I am suppose to be happy
jesus christ
am I suppose to be sad I missed it or happy?
you
and
ya know I want to be remembered as one of the greatest and most progressive humans to ever live, to have in some way permanently left my mark on humanity
Jesus Christ
*I done did bamboozle you*
he says
he grows an extra hand out his chest with a knife already there and right before he stabs them
sometimes ted bundy or some other famous one acted like they had a broken arm to lure their victim into a false sense of security
weeg
the most successful serials killers usually look weak though
it's worked surprisingly well
family reunions were basically just a free killing ground for her
she actually has killed her entire family
oh dear
gran can't be put in an elderly home because she murders everyone she knows
oh jesus
grandma's practicing for when the time comes to crack some skulls
put me in a home and I put you in the ground

***someone needs to make this happen***
***I was saying why as in why isn't this a real thing yet***
*my god why*
my god
the subject was bound to change once I mentioned grans
it's as easy as pushing your no good for nothin gran down three flights of stairs?
what the hecko do you do to win a championship
I'm a pro ipad gamer guys
fortnite for ipad
ah yes
oh nice
do you think they sell used elbows?
my arms are taking constant abuse
I slammed my elbow into my ipad
ouchie
also
yeah
then I realized it wouldn't be worth it
I was going to offer to pay you to turn it in
some small part of your brain is still sane
I'm a very smaret
I had to change all my haikus cause I remembered Mt. Fuji is three syllables
fair enough
depriving him of two squiggles
what a cruel punishment
oh dear
did you?
night
sounds good
ideally
probably
something tells me that would just make me hate myself even more
I drink every night so I don't have any free time to actually think about my life
I do drink every day excessively at 8 pm to 12 pm
that actually explains a lot
ah
how could that be faked
also I found their website
I am by no means defending it
boring is relative
also most people do think it's boring
ah
oh
but I've forgot it even existed
I actually used to watch a few races here and there
who even watches nascar anymore
goodnoot
you've gone 48 hours with a melted brain?
I blame it on that
sometimes my fingers just seize up
sweet
woag
absolutely
racist?
Germans and Chinese shouldn't mix
rip
*and he turns back towards you*
you call for him to kill all the racially inferior
yeah
my little hitler slave
bombs
bye
they are being killed before my eyes
night
b!define pokagontis
I was a fully formed child
except I wasn't a blade of grass
I popped out of the dirt
the plot thicken into a weird glob like mass
this is insane
my god
how could you possibly know that
no one would be laughing cause we would *be dead*
that makes sense
ah
why must you do this
all it needs to do is stay this way
this is perfect
all online now
I'll have to switch to online now
how dare you
both of yous
stop going online
shoot
not anymore
there
I feel left out
woah everyone is idle
I'm going to drown
anyways
i assume so
definitely
yup
but I said sentenced to life not death
I do yearn for death
I could be sentenced to life if I give context
I do mind very much
oh god this dude is drowning
what you said
yeah
you cannot at all
quality conversation
thats not okay
okay
thats
"maybe"?
why
little pig boy
freaking
god
tHanKs GoAt MaN
tHaNkS a BoMb
tHaNkS oBaMa
listen up sheeple
those god dang lizard men tricked the general populace again
drive thrus are fake, lies perpetuated by the New World Order
woag
i dont think so
they operate in the shadows
i have to buy absurd amounts of tape
really a hassle to fix
drilling holes in my wall again
drilling holes in my skin
drilling holes in my wall
indeed
messing with the stats
oh dear those darn grombles
magic dwarves
is it good and well now?
apart from the fact you lost power
so you have first hand experience
but when you boil it down the emotions in fiction (should) be ones you experienced as well
especially something like a romantic plot
why would you write a plot about something you dont know much about?
indeed, but if no one minds me asking the question
thats nice
hello*
gluten tagg
oh rip
i will be thoroughly surprised when, really if, that day comes
you've been 800 away for weeks
"***yeAH***"
"and that's just too much?"
"***yeAh thEy wAnt EqUaL***"
"Do -(computing stupidity)- When you say more do you mean equal?"
"And the gay couple, they want... more."
"well, no but, the regular couple they work so hard, you know."
"to the gay couple?"
it is such a strange contraption
they somehow lack the conscience to see that they said two contradicting things because they apparently lack any ability to have a mental capacity over that of a two year old who recently learned to speak
so they voice them
but they also have very strong personal feelings
so they say they do
and its a bad thing to say you dont
mostly because they know for a fact its a good thing to say you believe in equality
to solve that cognitive dissonance
twisted ideologies
some people come up with weird
when someone believes in two contradicting things
its called cognitive dissonance
"***nO***"
"Islam?"
"Yes."
"Judaism?"
"I do."
"So you respect Christianity?"
"its important to, ah, to believe in, you know, to have respect for everyone's religion"
i dont like humans
I...
i want to end myself now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Zdx97A63s
bye
they sleep
my god
small insect like legs ruptured from my torso ripping out flesh on the way out
the shaking intensified immensely
then the second phase began
due to the extreme pain of the whole ordeal i am unaware of the class all staring in amazement at me
my legs follow a similar process
my arms slowly retract into my torso, first the left one then the right one, and once they retract completely they make a satisfying popping noise
i then begin to shake intensely as my body prepares itself for the transformation
i place myself in a spread out position face down on the floor
in response, and panic, to being called upon by the teacher i stand up from my chair and walk five paces forwards
second try
ill restart my monologue later
ill keep that in mind the next time you ask me for something
you interrupted me and my monologue
I SWEAR TO GOD GUS
my arms slowly retract into my torso, first the left one then the right one, and once they retract completely they make a satisfying popping noise
i then begin to shake intensely as my body prepares itself for the transformation
i place myself in a spread out position face down on the floor
in response, and panic, to being called upon by the teacher i stand up from my chair and walk five paces forwards
a          h
maybe shake intensely before the legs come out
blood everywhere
and the freaking centipede legs bursts from my torso
my arms and legs retract into my body
thats when i lay face down on the floor
Dr. Doko says: you are an insect
rip
weeg
thats not a very sharp picture
why would he take a picture himself
just because he sent it from google doesnt mean he hasnt seen it
**where do you live ben**
collapse the children
stop that
no
doesnt
that
erm
foreigner
ya weirdo
yup
where the hecc do you live
clearly
your insane
byee
also
rain started up again fool
**my god waht is that**
you dont care about most things it appears
also im very aware you dont care
or structuring them
or at least ending sentences with it like that
which is where i get isnt it from
innit it?
or if you wanna be really british you say
its just i have a mortal phobia of my wrist being hurt
also its really not that bad
ohhh
sample
but i will never say if im hurt in any way again
it actually did hurt
and i scrapped my wrist with the pointy end
and i was putting the sword while i was there
i stabbed my wrist cause i was laying on the floor of my room
also
woag
now its really sunny and not raining
weeg
oh wait
same
but the pointy end can still kinda stab
I can run my finger along the edge of the blade
like the end
the point is still pointy
my wrist is a whole world of pain
but god
that's helpful and all
holi pepperoni my backyard is a river
we live in the same general area
yes
BUT THE SWORD SCRATCHED ALONG THE INSIDE OF MY WRIST
I can handle a tornado
it was just a poke
IT WAS LIGHT TOUCH
IT WAS RIGHT ON MY WRIST
BUT THE END POINTY BIT CAN STAB THROUGH LIKE CLOTHES AND STUFF
IT'S BEEN DULLED
THE END
LIKE THE ACTUAL POINTY BIT TOO
OW
I JUST STABBED MYSELF WITH MY SWORD
weeg
it's been lifted so
woag
alrighty
hitler was bound to die the moment the war lasted even just a few years
indeed
i think they've taken away enough
jesus
yup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmiMN2v0o04
im listening to this
congrats im just watching the video
*yes the onion*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0M0PsaTLk
au revoir madam ravioli
byee
shelby's lesbian lover: **bigger chungus**
give me editing software and i make art
im so proud of myself

no need
im lazy and i dont want anything new
i know
in case that cancer gets too cancerous a select few people can hide in there
weeg
i have 28.5k messages in total
the brutal fight for third place continues
nearly 1k messages ahead
haha
now it is
weegoog
you can actually add channels if you have good ideas ya know
shelby you barely ever use your permission to do stuff
weeg
erm
oh god you guys do
do you have the permission to
like
can you guys ban?
but clearly now that you swore
i thought you were a good person
i cant believe you jacob
we do know
he would be much scarier if he did though
there's a difference
he simply ignores it
trump doesnt silence the truth
we probably wouldnt know how incompetent he was if it was
the truth is still very much not silenced
YOU CANT SILENCE THE TRUTH
i shall never be silenced
now*
that also makes a lot of sense
the national weather service did send a warning a very dangerous tornado was about so i think you are justified in worrying at least a bit
also
iM gOnnA tELL a TEaCheR
wOAG
well that makes sense
now i wish it did
if the storm actually did form a massive tornado that killed people i think you wouldnt like the fact that you have messages permanently on a discord of you saying you like it
in fact it would be weird if she didnt scream at the storm
its not all too abnormal
weeg
i doubt they did
punctuates it well
i like the scream at the end

right
why
e x a c t l y
alrighty
poor seymour
also the strong boi wind just freaking ripped off a big boi arm of the tree in my backyard
and that is basically what 90% of your messages are on this discord
weeg
also it wasnt my idea to leave early
alrighty
ah
scream at the top of your lungs 'go away you smelly storm, i'll freaking stab you'
please do
stand there and scream
oh yeah
you just scream at them
but instead of taking measurements of things
maybe you should be a storm chaser
so I basically left you all to die
also I was pulled early because my parents were worried about the severe storm warnings and tornado warnings to the east
woag
as such I will leave in social fear
I'll take silence as an uncomfortable ending to this conversation
"well then you are very smart" gus talking to tyler 2019
yes
I'll quote you on that
you see I'm smart enough not to watch that
ah
no explanation?
that might be a problem
well
ah
an entire night to have a conversation and neither of you have taken a higher position
hello
s? top
your welcome
I'll show mercy this time
fine
I'll have to deduct from your pay for those shenanigans
good morning
WoAg
wOaG
I know
the clocks are striking 13
this'll really convince you
I'm a kool kid
what of it?
that's right I'm edgy and pretentious enough to quote 1984 despite reading only half of it
ignorance is strength
war is peace
freedom is slavery
*insert intense wheezing here*
THERE AREN'T ANY
OH LOOK AT THAT
b!define any of my original jokes
as long as it's roughly a circle it should be fine
wat
I was actually much sadder earlier in the day
I wish I had charlotte now
aw
god, I hate being sick
that's the only spelling error I see
b!define gnat
I think you mean gnat sam
b!define nat
fact checking
wait a moment
odd
why would you think that
you are estabon after all
that makes sense
alrighty
errmmm
and ill threaten you with
haha I win again
so I'm staying up
but I'm staying alive with my self destructive habits
maybe I should stay alive
fine
ill be dead before then so neither you nor me have to worry about that
I ain't sleepin'
that would improve my mood a lot
I wish I wasn't sick
I'm dying from the sniffles ***AHHHHHHHHHHH***
I know
imagine the purge with this group of friends
yes
also
if I ran around slaughtering pakistani children I wouldn't be branded as a war hero, I'd be a criminal
warfare is just legal murder between countries as well
execution is just legal murder
that's what I thought
if you are a hippy
execution arguably is murder
sharpen the swords
notch the arrows
we execute rebels here at Shelby is Big Gay, Both of Them Inc.
don't spam
this isn't funny it's tragic to see this man being manipulated by his closest peers
steel is heavier than feathers
poor limmy
this man is being lied to
I don't get it
are you like a freakin fortune teller or oracle of some kind
I am back, even after a short detour, and no mayhem has started
yet your spirit was apparently mislead
that's the spirit
dont let everything go wrong
ill be gone for twenty seconds
i think i'll do that
so maybe i should actually rest
my face and head is feeling warm again
also i feel like i should go back down
then i realized what had happened
and i stared at it in few seconds in confusion
from bacon man
"The tree is trying to vore me"
today at 9:26
and i saw
and i look at it
i was going to the message search bar to see how many times you have said tree
you know what was most interesting about that message
there is nothing wrong with hugging a tree
go make friends with a tree
trees are nice
not the tree part
the blind part
that may be a problem
***im proud***
this man is in law enforcement dutifully protecting the city of jeffersonville
also can you see who i get my personality from?
i think the flying spaghetti monster has decided that he is the new carrier of the second return of spaghetti jesus
i dont know he just walked through the living room clutching his enlarged stomach while saying "im pregnant with a true pastafarian"
im scared
also my dad just claimed to be pregnant with a pastafarian
i am confused by the structure of that sentence
i feel like i should go back downstairs
probably
weeg
~~also im lazy~~
not much lost
then oh well
and i cant come up with something good
plus if we dont
it might be better that way
you never know
maybe something better will happen if i have to last second improvise
it'll spice up the morning
oh yeah
ill just check in the morning last second
it'd be weird if we didnt
i should probably check
do we even have ritz crackers
ben 90% of your messages in the last week has been "hm"
i hopped on there for like a second before running away so i wouldnt know
oh
i dont remember
actually
how
thats
henlOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i think he is the main supplier of it all
weeg
the more and more you deny the more and more i assume you have been deeper and deeper in the rabbit hole of nsfw roblox content
it makes you look all the worse when you do
you have to talk about it now
you cannot deny
you cant direct the conversation away from what you implied
you keep incriminating yourself
thank god
i dont doubt its a dedicated account
nor what kind of things you can see
thank you, you have no idea what kind of rabbit holes you can go down
shelby you should stop immediately
please stop
**jennifer**
***if that even is your real fake name***
one can lie about their age jasmine
**do you write nsfw roblox poems jacob?**
if GOOGLE FREAKING LOADS
im actually going to try and find roblox poems
oh yeah
***i would pay for that***
***roblox poems written by 13 year olds***
***thats where the money is at***
weeg
so you are restarting or are you going to stay with them
only twelve lines
i N t E r E s T i N g
its
you might need to do that
oh frick son
im in amazement as well
i know
its magical
and i've actually bothered to make myself appear online
w OOoOo oOO
i can type real fast now
oh yeah
HAHA
rest is overrated
yeah
who needs to lie in bed while sick anyways
20 seconds
so I shall be back in like
also its bothering me now that I don't have the computer the more I think about it
one ritz cracker with a sticky note attached
I'm going to bring in a spine disc
well guess what
God fricking dang it I wish I was back on the computer so I could fact check stuff faster
I think
well spine discs are like the things between the vertebrate
I will never disrespect pi day
I want to bring in spine disc crackers
what I was going to originally say to the pi day thing
anyways
that sounds like a problem
you shouldn't be laughing then
all your liquid financial assets
HOW DARE THEE
HEY
who I have a fake irrational hatred for
they are smelly peoples
dirty french pig dogs
*oh*
that
oh
but I take it as that know
I don't think that means be the one to lead a suicide pact into the great oblivion
jump into the unknown
be the leader of the next great revolution
(only occasionally)
(sometimes)
(generally)
(but most people try to avoid hypocrisy so I do too)
(in fact I actually place an incredibly high value on human life, which would make suicide my last great hypocritical act)
(although I haven't tried to kill myself so I will disagree with the will to live part)
(fair enough)
**Him**
no
**Him**
like the opposite side
also she does not have God on her side
why would you not want to die in the operation but then kill yourself afterwards
don't you have to be awake to operate (im learning) on yourself?
it sounds painful
I would pay for a large portion of the medical operation
from the top
ANYWAYS
JESUS
I AM STUPID
OPERATION
HAHA
operation
my brain is malfunctioning
opporation
do I not know how to spell
am I just stupid
**jesus christ yes**
eventually your old ones will shed and fall off
just grow new hands and arms
that was a terrible transition
why
jacob
I don't know
it
I know
also wow am I high?
immature*
I feel like I should eject while I can
this is gonna devolve fast
it's hue-man nature
typically people avoid strange conversations
*lel*
I'm also breathing
good plan
it's a pretty good will
hopefully your will is followed
I don't blame you
exactly did fit better though
thank you
but it sandwiches my message in an awkward way due to both of us saying it
you can't say exactly that soon after
I just said exactly
silence is an admission of guilt
exactly
homo boy is not an insult you want to use jabob
someone backing me up
haha
really it doesn't matter as long as you get them finished within my lifetime
ah god I dropped my phone on myself in excitement
***yEs***
YES
well it was perfect timing for the situation either way
also what I like is that shelby went online momentarily, discord said she was typing, and then she went right back to the sweet bliss of death
it failed so hard to prove anything I came back from the dead momentarily just to mock you
like really what did you expect out of that response
indeed
well that backfired pretty hard then in that case
why would that be?
gettin a bit defensive there gus
double devil numbers broke it thats what
this is rigged
boop?
s? top
au revoir sweet dreams
due to the large amount of damage to my brain causing me to slip into a deep and never recovering depression
because im incapable of that now
hope you had a good time
and that was all for today folks
*nurm*
so:
i like repeating myself
good
whome***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
also i looked at my arm for a moment and it was going all wacky with veins being more visible than they should be
so you didnt invent a word
its only a word if people agree it's a word
b!define whome
exactly ben
i feel great
also that was a nice self loathing session
no one should feed your addiction
you are addicted
im going to disappear for a spontaneous (not so spontaneous) session of self loathing, so dont go too crazy
congrats now you have access
good job
you have access to it now
it really does
weirdo
everyone who wants to read the poem say "I snorted half of this dude before"
i just came up with crap and wrote it down cause id much rather be procrastinating than doing stuff so i made a crappy poem
it doesnt make much sense if you think about it hard enough
no clue
not sure
also i made my poem about some guy who gets trapped in a fish bait box he bought
look above at the image
david hughes is one interesting guy
its like magic
* insert comment here yet tyler was too stupid to come up with one funnier than a pretty crappy meta/self deprecating joke on how he cant come up with anything *
gus is basically the god of reposting by now
I thought it was to further immerse yourself in the game
why the balloons
i g u e s s
woaggGGG
which i would welcome with open arms
the sarcasm from this interaction may actually give me a disease of some kind
this wonderful new thing i never knew about before now
please explain this wonderful thing
i've never heard of it
what is this google?
wow really???????????????
where do you find these
aw
anyways im going to go back into the shadows from whence i came
b!define whence
which makes it all the more pathetic
literally nothing
***THIS GUY***
guess who just wants to freaking have a steady enough hand to end their life
guess who just wants to throw themselves off a cliff
also guess who wants to rip out their own insides
right
kicked*
bye I have to leave
let the rats reinvigorate you
obviously
actually not really that surprising
that's
ah
why would you woo to that
that's not a good thing at all
you should've installed a gps tracking system in your glasses
errrrrm
oh dear
no need to convince me
I'm just slightly sick I should be fine
they would I think
I'll be fine
I'm already dressed and told my parents I'm going
it's not enough to warrant staying home
I like sniffle occasionally and the front of my head has that slight sick feeling
a little bit
I wanna go back to bed and sink into it but now I've commuted myself to going to school
his small polio fingers twitch frequently
his small polio fingers twitch more than occasionally
*oh jesus*
and disturbing
handshakes would be awkward
***yES***
wow
watching him dance would be a holy experience
weeg
then cut to him screaming while vigorously scribbling
does whatever a pencil can
pencil man
pencil man
spine disc crackers and now pencil man
I don't know where I've gotten this epiphany of amazing ideas recently
I know
all of this in the middle of class
the image of someone leaning over a paper while vigorously scribbling, and after a while of doing that angrily quietly they start screaming in frustration
my god
you'd like be able to move the pencil in a jerky way cause of how it's attached to your stump
I know
just one though
but also as a replacement
not only as a tool to cut off the arm cleanly
pencils will do the trick
weeg
I slept on my arm and now I cannot feel it, I will now have to perform a surprise amputation on myself
this is where I die
oh jesus my headphones are tangled around my leg
the people inside my veins are running a bit faster and harder than usual I guess
I'm too warm now
I just witnessed murder
I'm yearning for nom noms
sleeping is for the weak
goodn o O T
scary
that's
jesus
well yeah
the hell?
also surely sam is being contained by others
it's sporadic and miserable but if I keep feeling like I am now I should be fine for tomorrow
cause like I said not too long ago my body temperature was badly off track
I say should
I *should* be fine enough
your welcome
*the kindness radiates off of you shelby*
goodnoight
I swear on the Spaghetti Monster Himself
five times
I patted him
not even thrice
not twice
I really did pat him not once
also why would I lie about patting tad?
I GET HIGHS OFF OF THIS
THEN IT FEELS GREAT
IT FEELS BAD UP UNTIL THEY ARE UNTANGLED
AHA
I'm very busy untangling headphone cords
I'm sorry but I don't think I can give out that insurance right about now
id kill him
I gave him five pats
how many pats
I will
I'm pressing charges
right
long story
yup
both lungs in fact
he did
good ded'd
oh god that doesn't sound right
you died at school?
frick
ouchie my lungs are freaking angery and are trying to kill me
I'm like underneath two stuffed animals, an actual animal, and a blanket and I'm freezing
my body temperature is all out of whack
that sounds like violent suicide just with extra steps
I don't know who gets the money
and confused
I'm sad now
I lost a bet with myself
its ageism
no
OOH
thats really the best thing for it
exclusion?
thats not even racism
sorry mate
one of the downsides of immortality is exclusion
thats kinda missing the point
i banished him from this mortal realm
he ded
***BEGONE FOUL DEMON***
***BEGONE FOUL BEAST***
doing that
yup
late gluten tagg
okay?
erm
his story shall go down generations
indeed
oh dear
relatable
interesting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S8SsRnjiS0

thank you so much troom troom
no one should have ever trusted me with finger hands


im on a rampage
how romantic

i put freaking hands on the propellers of a sea plane
i really dont think that is what you should be focusing on
or asian if you prefer
cause im half hispanic
why am i so tan or why did i put hands on the propellers of a sea plane?
im normally like that?

aHA
but bye
its probably not for the best considering i came up with a better idea
she got up when i got up
also charlotte bamboozled me
relatable
wait a momento
i suppose i should try
m  y  g  o  d
m y g o d
i dont even wanna think about what the content of that would be
a                                                 h ?
i just wanna know what that sign says
a h
and have the geneva conventions in it, it would make a great prop for jokes
i need like a booklet
i should try that some day
keep driving
pro life tip for this person who is most likely a human being
***heart juices***
*i mean what i said*
it gets your heart juices a little too angry
weeg
then you proceed to go into comatose due to too many flintstone gummy vitamins
*...yes i do..*
yes i do
yes
i would listen to it
if not a little more deadly than usual
driving in russia sounds exciting
she is after all a Deceitful Hider of Things (Specifically Messages)
but she may be needed later
how can you be trusted?
you are a Deceitful Hider of Things (Specifically Messages)
exactly
you deceitful hider of things (specifically messages)
dont delete your messages
that may be like his uncle or something
tad has pink splotches as well
let me check
i dont think tad looks exactly like that
weeg
w ow
j us t
wow
they are invasive, feral little beasts
but the gnaw on everything
they chase out the rats
well
there are midgets in my walls
thats a nice word for a not very nice thing
b!define subterfuge
waaAACk
subterfuge
oOOOOOoooh
Odd
but apparently it doesnt have that O in there
i know
yes its ruse
aHA
b!define ruse
the ruse
just try your best
anyways
that rouse
nope
mmmm
b!define rouse
rouse?
just try your best to keep the rouse
he said my name and started talking to ben about the clarinet thing and i was very confused for half a second
yesterday that is
i almost mixed it up immediately
please watch how you interact and speak around him
so take it as you will
but im also insane
i like to think its doing some good in that way
and its funny
its not hurting anyone
its just names
it really isnt
i think he actually does
i dont think dog heaven has just two dogs
how could you do this to yourself
that's just sad
well
**do it**
go pat it without asking
of course it is
im not sure
thats
o                         h
i thought it was like jelly, with no form
i didnt know you could break your back
pat yourself on the back
not really
good job i guess
okay
ah
really?
so you dropped your phone that way?
erm
thats
why
how
well really the consistency and texture seems like it would depend a lot on the song in question being consumed
i dont think you can eat songs
once before i go to sleep
once when i wake up
i listen to every day
***SANS SONG***
*what part of the beautiful undertale soundtrack is your favorite?*
**ah**
so scared in fact that you spelled it with two E's instead of one
exactly
shush
which was why i was so surprised when i was laying in the bathroom at 3 in the morning with stab wounds in both lungs
weeg
neither did i
also tad freaking stabbed me in the lungs
i guess im a bit sick still
but i was
i mean not now
yes
also
its too late
***reeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEE***
**but rattling change**
literally everything else about them is almost perfect
but not enough to ruin it
i think there is a little bit
i think
two
so i sadly i just had to add like
i would add almost every song to my stupid little playlist thingy if it didnt have **rattling change**
gluten tagg
it really would be
but it would be really good if it wasn't there
it fills me with fury
but nooOOOOoooO
it would be good if it wasnt there
***i dont want this***
***it ruins it***
**but some of them has freaking what sounds like rattling change**
so i thought the rest of them would be
but the intro song was awesome
i have no idea how i found this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYUgqFmBb-8
wait a momento
i have gained a new burning hatred for rattling loose change
woah
byee~
remember tad stabbed me
*o h*
*your heart juices are just getting spicy*
*don't worry man*
if someone is getting emotional, comfort them by saying
frickity frackity
I had a topic in mind
I forgot what I was going to originally say now
small brained boov
oh yeah
I blame Obama
also Charlotte is freaking crushing me
please use that in everyday conversation and small talk
***right and yes***
but I had it copied at some point to quickly interject into the conversation
I don't know what I am to do with this information
hence high brow, someone having a higher brow
did you know that the term high brow originates from the outdated idea that people with larger heads, specifically the backs and such, were more intelligent?
**oh**
which is?
so I act like I know my spleen juices from each other, and I only take gourmet spine disc crackers
I'm just a pretentious hipster who wants attention
I don't care for the taste
I prefer only that fancy high brow stuff
maybe dip those spine disc crackers in the spleen juice
indeed
I know
so why not spine disc crackers
spleen juice is a thing
I got a good idea
while I was thinking about joking how tad had brutally eviscerated me
good
bye~
yes please do that
**this is the side of him I like**
aww
tell everyone at school tad freaking killed me
everyone on the discord who is awake to read this message
I'm consuming many a liquid to stop the tidal wave of pain
my throat is soree**eeEEEEEEEEE**
either way I'm staying home though
that's a good idea
and that's a huge no no in my brain
it makes it generic
but writing down generic stuff doesn't make something good
probably
even if it is small
but on the other hand I'm too immature to be emotionally honest and vulnerable to literally anyone without weeks of preparation
on one hand I want it to be good cause I'm a good boi
I'm very conflicted about it
~~and I'm also staying home to avoid turning in the poem~~
also I probably should stay home if I'm sick
just do that for the next 365 days
good job
morning
oh whelp
probably a bit idiotic to stay up this long
I should probably sleep
I'm like almost sick and it's getting miserable
thanks for nothing Peppa Pig (which is also my favorite anime)
my heart juices got real funky and now I'm freaking dying
ouchie
I think my heart juices just got a bit too spicy and my insides are subsequently feeling like they are exploding

screw you
step aside scientists who spent decades accurately mapping the carbon emissions in western brazil
yeah
wow
accepting one after another
***all of them***
weeg
even before you sent it before
sadly I think I've seen that before
homophobe
frosty the snowman doesn't want this slander
why
also
alrighty
just tell me up until a certain message of yours
alrighty
up until when
also how much deletion?
why yes it is
she can look back through the discord messages you know that right?
**[redacted conversation]**
indeed
(no I don't, sorry?)
weeg
didn't you ask that before?
like?
'where were you'
I really don't think being inactive on discord for like a day, and not even a full day, warrants many questions other than
my favorite game
weeg
eating the spleen instead of drinking
uncivilized ohians(?)
trust none of them
weeg
**everyone in ohio is an alien**
**warning my guys**
what are they hiding
im pretty sure a disproportionate amount of astronauts come from ohio
I think there is an alien conspiracy involving ohio
why ohio nasa
woag indeed
frcik I want to die so bad everything hurts
GOD WHY
AAAAAAAAAAAH
LIVING IS PAIN
AHHHHHHHH
life is terrible
im going to disappear a few moments
weeg
nice censor

i dont understand why russians are so bad at driving
gluten tag
sad
s o r r y ?
goodbye
bye
same
I keep a little in my pocket at all times in case of emergency
wet dog food and/or cat food is the best
it's really quite nice
***but ya gotta eat dog food***
no worries
snowed in for months?
bags upon bags
the kinda food I store for winter is dog food
so theoretically it is possible
can someone be financially forced to eat cat or dog food?
does cat food cost more than regular crappy food?
~~also we're downgrading your pay~~
so just say good morning or your children will starve
results speak more than words
so keep up, alright?
and here at Good Mornings Inc. we need that in employees to succeed
it's called work ethic
one more move like that and ill have to fire you
you've been lacking on your good morning quota
I'm sorely disappointed
that's a pretty late good morning
morning
not at all
like a few moments ago
I got a very strange burning sensation in my left wrist randomly
only one way to find out
welp
and technically nothing matters and we're all going to die
that sounds like a very slippery slope
it feels empty without another living being
I would know
she isn't being forced
that's not true
but mostly I believe in free will
also that's a song
if she doesn't want to sleep on my bed she doesn't want to
that's *r00d*
I wish charlotte was here
that's odd
it is
sadly that is something that has to stay in the realm of speech
I don't think you can convey you randomly mumbling off in text
***what is this madness***
Oh dear
it doesn't convey it as well
well I really think human psychology is a really interesting but undermanned subject I mean understanding actually I goes I'm rtraining sank solely start
now the question is can you somehow simulate mumbling off a bit at the end of a sentence or paragraph in text?
you are just as coherent on phone as you are in person
*and if so why would I look forward to it?*
*are you threatening to break my foot in two weeks?*
I was very confused a moment till I remembered you were on phone
***footing break***
I WANT IT TO BURN
AH FRICK
SCHOOL
AGHHHH
good
Oh whelp
I think you nearly killed me
I have to say that is one of the most disturbing sentences I have ever read
"Everynight before you go to sleep make sure to give them 7 kisses each as this is the amount they’re used to. 6 of which are placed wherever you’d like though typically they enjoy their general body areas. One kiss however is placed on their ***little chubby tums*** because they are ***little chubsters and they need to know that I love their tiny tums.***"
while I install docs on my phone I have to make a small comment
something tells me they do
don't signatures have to be in person?
this doesn't seem legal either
how
it's still not legal till your 18
so sad
ree's that are cut off short
how long?
that's an amazing image
wow
that
can one ree in a sad way?
it doesn't sit well with me as the other ideas do
I dunno
like maybe the worker that was killed was family and mr. ghosty doesn't take it all too well and decides to ruin it from the inside like the slippery eel he is
I would need a motivation behind mr. ghosty screwing over his long time friend like that
I don't know whether to make the deaths more the fault of bad design and safety precautions overlooked by Dandoon or the work of something more sinister
I dunno
that's what I got for the disappearances
he hires the private detective
none come out
ten people go in
after some time (four years) he wants to finally re open the museum and on opening day he lets in a small class from a local school in
he finally ropes it off and sinks into a manic depression which the idea of the beast has time to fester and come full formed
1886 his wife and child go missing inside, a bronze statue of her and her holding her child's hand is constructed at the end of the vast museum
he also begins to think of the idea of a beast responsible for the disappearance
he continues the tradition of constructing a memorial here as well
and his friend goes missing
split up
and they get turned around
something happens (ill figure it out later)
1885 He and a life long friend end up venturing in there just to spend sometime together
1884 Dandoon loses his pet parrot inside and in Dandoon fashion he constructs an elaborate memorial inside the museum for him
in 1882 an irish construction worker gets killed in a freak workplace accident
obviously this gains national headlines but after years of nothing he fades into obscurity
and finally in 1877 he sells off his entire company in a very sudden manner in order to build a museum of oddities and to travel
over time his mental health seems to deteriorate
and quickly became rich
essentially this dude at a very early age taps into the massive wealth to be gained from railroads
but I am referring to the museum owner as Dandoon
I'm crap at names so I'll come up with them later but for now I have placeholders
namely the people who disappeared inside, the dates, and the lay out of it
I've tried working out some more of the details on the whale museum
God that would be terrible
that's a terrifying thought
indeed
"poke your finger in someone's mouth while they're yawning to establish dominance"
ohno
you'll send them through layers and layers of legal crap
that they won't be able to follow
I would hate to be your family when you die
which is illegal
sounds like desecration of a corpse
I don't think
no
"My brother wants this played at his funeral. He want it to be a closed casket then when they open it up he isn't in there and say 'where is he?' Then this song starts and a spot light goes onto a giant catapult with him in it and when it goes **come on and slam and welcome to the jam** they shoot his body into a giant basketball hoop"
on an upload of the space jam theme song
also
such is the dangers of polygamy sadly
Oh GOD
I think it should be important to note that WIRES autocorrected to WIFE'S at first
MY WIRES ARE ALL TANGLED
AHHHHH
you aren't the only one
gabe has cursed many of us
***REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
I WANT IT ALL
I want it
there is no random saving grace for the characters
I want a dark sitcom but the penalties are very drastic and very realistic
out of freaking no where
THAT is when it flies through the window and falls four stories
***duct taped to the ceiling fan***
when you look back he is holding the baby over his head, facing the window and poised to freaking yeet that thing through the glass and down four stories
you turn away a few moments
let him hold him for a little
imagine letting your good lifelong friend meet your newborn son
push a few grandmas
chuck a few babies
stab a few people
I mean it doesn't sound all too hard
*a murderer*
my dream job
I aspire to be him everyday
I know
***and he has two kills***
later on I come across my liege who is this poor five year old in charge of this empire
and moved on
I thought that sounds fun
I was playing ck2 one day and in a newer update they added a kill count tab on characters
sounds incredibly messy and imprecise
how much is a xylophone cause now I want one
exactly
listen to it again and again until you either figure out what you said or go insane
it can't be that bad
yup
and also taking into account the rapid automation of jobs
he's the only candidate I've ever seen advocating for UBI
just Google him
Andrew Yang is an interesting candidate for president
goodn o O t
goodnoot
but shhhhHHH
I will be downloading it for usage later though
jesus
sicko
what's wrong with you
I should have the word incest spelled out on a rainbow picture just for these circumstances
weeg
"It would be cool if after you died you could see the top 5 times you almost died"
sounds like something he would say after making homosexuality illegal
weeg
I'm saving it in my memory for further use later
I'm proud
that's a cool sounding quote
I think what is right
I don't think what I like
I still don't think it's a weed number
it seems the more logical way
erm
that seems like an improper way of judging a day
just because of that?
also today is the 69th day of 2019
hmmmmmmmmmMMM
"jews for jesus"
alrighty
ah
a h?
it would explain why he was gone this long
and he did have a 13 year long affair
he did keep a slave
I was kinda walking along and found his half eaten body with a few baby grombles gnawing on him
such an untimely death for such a bright spider monkey
but probably not remembered
Dimmel was freaking eaten alive by grombles
by the way
learning math makes me want to yeet myself into a wood chipper
gggAYYYYYYYYY
gaymers?
erm
R
a measly 68
it's gone now
too late
my phone is at 69%
neither do I
Dandoon
all the letters repeat other than the A
Mr. Dandoon
maybe
yes
no
right
***¿HMMMMMM?***
hm?
squooze the water out of ice cubes
farp
it wouldnt be communist if it wasnt free
***42***
**yes**
4
yup
right
I crave death
I should really sleep
I'm dying
I've even seen that particular robot before for sure
it twas just a joke
I'm aware
looks like just a nor-mal hue-man fee-male
oh weeg
odd
what kinda weird?
it's only weird if it has a talking squirrel
there you go
stun
well I'm going to fall asleep eventually
exactly
I think ill go to sleep
I'm very confused
I don't know how
I know
oh shoot son
I SHALL PLUNGER THY FACE TO DEATH
another thing that came to mind was "this dude is pulling a dalek and revealing themselves by slaughtering the guards and being just generally not affected by their bullets" albeit daleks are a bit more silly I have to admit
it wasn't
I did not know that hoomans could explode into freaking excessive amounts of jelly like those guards did
I'm still alive and kicking
the me leaving
no
I watched the first eight minutes like you told me to
right
and now I don't want to
I'm just doing something right now
I will watch it though
just because the shelbys did as well don't mean nothing
of course you'd like borderline hentai
right
I figured
bold of you to assume
I'm doing something else right now
okay
erm
I'd really rather not
possibly
possibly
Shelby just went to sleep
goodnight~
no need to be sorry
it's fine
with a candlestick
in the hallway
which is the silence
ill be writing this stuff down by the way
maybe it'll come back
oh frick
that was more of something I was going to keep in my head but that whole monster thing just fit in with it too well
indeed
aHA
the disappearances and the made up monster in the detectives mind is supposed to be the result of unfettered creativity
the wonderful and creatively amazing museum is suppose to be the good side to creativity
IT JUST CLICKED
OH MY GOD THAT FITS IN WITH THE THEMES I HAD IN MIND
holi pepperoni this is a good idea
however everyone actually did disappear and perish due to non-beastly reasons
a sort of red herring if you will
and the more numerous the disappearing persons become
and also it doesn't help that the further the detective descends the more ridiculous the buildings become
so there is this kinda thing where you aren't entirely sure whether to believe this insane man
gets paranoid
being all alone
and the detective
but then comes the chapter from a vague out of detective point of view
at first this is dismissed by the detective
which is that a beast has escaped and has eaten the children
what would be a lovely bit of tension is that before the detective descends into the madness of the caverns and buildings below the whale the eccentric man tells him his personal hunch
I only said that just so I could at least say I tried
I know
also if you are tired you should probably sleep
thankk
and all the other disappearances add so much more there
it would add suspense that would otherwise not be there
but not only would two perspectives deepen the mystery and keep momentum forwards
I was thinking of randomly adding a character in there just to see if that would work
him just exploring?
I mean what's it suppose to be
I was just about to talk about how even if the ending was in sight the middle would still be a bit boring
no its a good one
very solid
indeed it is
but an end would be nice
I've got the set up there
plus the plot is terribly underdeveloped
I came up with some of the details right when I was telling you then
I spent maybe half an hour on it in total
story right there
boom bam it's told from the perspective of the detective
this eccentric and possibly deranged in some ways man hires a private detective to quickly find the class before he gets sued very heavily and goes completely bankrupt
until they disappear inside the depths
nothing surprising
one day a small class of ten are invited in from a local school
all of this is in a busy and growing new york
he nearly bankrupt himself in constructing elaborate structures and caverns underneath the whale
the whale is just the entrance
and he sells it all of to build the museum
eccentric
eh
later and later in life he becomes more
the museum was constructed by a fabulously wealthy however eccentric american businessman who earned his massive fortune from a railroad tycoon
I'm thinking it's the late 1800s
I'm thinking of fleshing out the idea more
you remember that murder mystery inside of a museum that was constructed inside of a massive dead whale
I have plenty of time for ideas
in the mean time
I think I'll just wait it out down here
my new home is the sewers
I'm responsible for the murder of 12 police officers, my entire family, and Dimmel's pet spider monkey
we have a problem
well
I'm afraid I don't have much time
a thirty second timer just started
I pressed the button
also
and DJ Lance was a danger to civilians alike
they are simply carrying out their civic duty
those cops aren't demons
the best thing to do is to forgive and understand
frankly even with this bad a situation
an eye for an eye is a toxic mentality that has only perpetuated violence in humanity
life is precious and violence isn't the answer
I don't know what I was thinking
I think I will
you know what
*I'm willing to sacrifice everyone I love and myself just to avenge DJ Lance from the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba*
well it'd take out the cops
it's that or a claymore I can't hold
either way
maybe during our vacations or somethin
I don't know
without anyone noticing?
and hook it all up to one button without a fail safe
he had time rig my entire house with explosives
**there is a self destruct button he has on a throne**
I hear them
the police are below
but it's just weed
with what should be normal houseplants inside
there are like these pots
night
the only way I did was cause I didn't see him much
how could you ever handle him?
man Dimmel is screwed up
he wasn't moving much anyways
gone
there
just
alrighty
but
i don't think it's been fed in a while
something seems wrong about that but I'll just move on
he has a pet spider monkey
erm
also
considering the whole 42 functioning eyes his reading glasses are just mesmerizing to look at
he has really weird reading glasses
what would you expect
he's been gone for a while
it's fine
blah blah
aspiring photographer
blah blah blah
don't mind if I do
he has a journal here as well
I guess it make a sense
other than the weed
I feel like he's hiding something
does whale dentistry pay this much?
some chairs are lined with gold
yeah
it's just weed
also that garden is not a garden
how does this all fit up here
a miniature garden
what
he has a random hockey court thingy
a palace that stinks of weed and is way too small for me
this place is like a palace
woah
I'm in and
IF HE EVER COMES BACK TO YOU TELL HIM THAT
I'M SORRY FOR VIOLATING HIS PRIVACY
DIMMEL WILL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME THOUGH
I GOT AN IDEA
AHA
channel my mole man
hiding underneath the bed sounds fun
I'm running
they literally just shot him dead before I could get up the stairs
***I'M READY***
**I shall wear my crown of hands into battle**
**indeed I shall**
I could throw them I guess
so it's also got a spoon and compass in there or something
they are like utility knives though
**all I have is a couple of bats and way too many knives**
**it's because I'm not lying**
I have no clue
he just blockaded my house and pulled a gun out his pants
the police are after him as well
oh god
I was very confused as to why he was still wearing the orange costume and staying in character
DJ Lance from the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba recently showed up to my house claiming he was my real father
but it's up to you
but maybe in your empire if that's alright
I would rather not have it on the main cancer chat
very nice to hear
it's a good thing either way
but it's good you are writing that stuff down
weeg
just writing anything or about what's happening in your life?
you're over it?
well by all means congrats
your going sober?
I don't mean that in a sarcastic way either
sorry
she doesn't care about what you say
yes
WE HAVE A WINNER
DING DING DING
your welcome for that vital bit of information
I couldn't think of a more normal way of mentioning that so
**über gay**
earlier today I apparently slept in just the right way to make my hair really wAvY and when I finally looked in the mirror I looked
thankkk
i will for sure
i will
but im able to choose the ones i like
im obviously not going to show all of them
im able to have a wider selection to show my parents then
i just wanted as many as possible
im able to parse through them
its fine
so not all of them?
so that's all of them?
weeg
**jesus christ**
oh jesus
im fully prepared
i've already got a folder prepared
**i need all of them**
anything and everything you all got
i'd appreciate it a lot
i need those st. louis pictures
OH CRAp
satan trying to escape
wait what
IM GASPING FOR AIR WHILE MY ARMS FLAIL WILDLY
IM DYING LAUGHING
THAT HILARIOUS
WOW
goodn o o t n o o t
goodnoot
good for thee
welp
yup
it wasnt all too refreshing for me
he feels like a side of beef
SWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
yeah
before
what i was originally trying to talk about
anyways
jacOb jUst diED
why?
can you please tell me
why?
none of you should be able to access it
can all of you quickly check to see if the permissions on the small tube shelter is working?
so ha
we have a fallout shelter just for that reason
are you okay jacob?
his sentence is up
i shall free the jabob
also
i dont even remember what i was talking about now
just "ReLaTaBlE mEmEs"
by now im sure that half of the stuff you send isnt even words
god i hate him
upon jabob's request i have extended his time to 15 minutes
i just muted him
let me find the timer
its gonna be ten minutes
im sorry jabob
we could move to another channel
i really dont want to
jacob ill have to mute you if you do something like that again
*gus its bad enough we dont need random "relatable" memes*
erm
r00d
does anyone have an instruction manual on them?
help my jacob is malfunctioning
stop
sincerely
please
but to have that fill my screen every two minutes
its one thing to have this many people on
jacob this is seriously getting out of hand
i know
you okay?
yes hello jabob
cause there are quite a few new ones
apparently i have to do this daily
im just scanning through
anyways
i cant finish my stories
it feels like more than seven
how many people are online
jesus christ
yup
it wont last for long
*ah*
to the freaking thing
this
with her downloading images like
how am i suppose to keep it nice and good
she just wont leave my random image folder alone
i swear to god my sister
<#522534502359236609> is feeling a little more cancerous today
it was actually the funniest thing i've read in quite some time
i know right
im bookmarking it
i know
sounds great
im sure
you okay jacob?
erm
i still havent looked into that and learned what is really was
youtube kids is disturbing at times
you apparently have no idea what the rest of the internet is like cause this is VERY tame
it really isnt that bad
the in depth look at it as a creation myth when it really is just a freaking kids tv show
because it is funny
**i love it**
https://www.somethingawful.com/news/gabba-mythology-brobee/
post this
i will however
right
its nothing much
yup it is
is yo gabba gabba fanfiction a thing?
im so sorry
im not sure
jacob?
hm?
how could you deny yourself of muno
well
oh
thefrick
really?
***i was in love***
muno was my role model
i was so sad when yo gabba gabba ended i almost threw myself off of my house
*its fascinating*
Hi I am watching the brutal murder of two Ethopian children who just wanted food!
being part of the yo gabba gabba cast was/is a dream of yours?
but i wouldnt want my children near them
i dont know about you
freaky little creatures
i know

it is lovely
and yes
i dont know why
also four of my eleven tabs i have open on google have to do with yo gabba gabba in some way
spoiler warning scooby doo dies in infinity wars
so no need
well he is kinda gone now
welcome back
eyyyyyyy
im not even going to attempt to argue against that point
its almost as if the same emoji pattern being repeated ten times in five minutes drives people away
its almost as if no conversation was happening and as such there wasnt much incentive to stay on
i know
everyone is gone now
well yeah
this is why i punish spamming
i swear to god i just want to talk
now can you stop sending it?
alrighty
hi meteor?
what would that be?
it means hi
im just trying to make yo gabba gabba jokes
and obnoxious
its kind of interrupting
posting the same thing over and over again isnt going to make me any more inclined to
not even going to try
why
jacob
dj lance from the children's tv show yo gabba gabba was recently exposed for doing hardcore drugs before and during the show
byee
i need to go to the shower that i should've taken an hour ago so see you all in a little bit, bye
which is tyler for
a tree just freaking consumed my left leg
let me speak tyler for a moment
calm down there
exactly
well
ah
i should probably learn jacob
alrightyyyyyyyyyyyyy
NO
i should probably learn jacob then
vomiting onto the keyboard isnt going to solve anything
what is happening
what the frick
***0H***
***cleaning a random homeless man named steve?***
***cleaning the bodies?***
and it went on for some time so its not like it cant be exhausted too fast
anyone could've joined at any point
THERE WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT SIDS SID THING
why
what are you doing jacob
***erm***
such is the wonder of a discord that mostly communicates through text
also you dont have to read it if you dont want to
honestly i am extremely invested in the story
***this traumatizes the child forever, for the rest of their life they work to better themselves only to not think it is enough, they die unhappy and at 50 due to stress and overexertion***
***only broken memories of what their mother was vaguely like is all gabriella imparts on her child***
***the child is left without a prominent mother figure in their early life and suffers as a result***
***eventually she gets into a heated fight with said significant other and they are unable to figure out their differences and split***
not ours
but know it is by your own hand
then you must suffer
***she never trusts herself around children of any kind again for the rest of her life***
***both of his parents end up dying in prison completely innocent, and not knowing how their beautiful new baby boy ended up dead under their bed***
***his parents are tried for murder and are sentenced to sixty years***
***she tells the authorities and sid is too frightened to come out and say he hid the body in panic***
***wO w***
***sid panics and hides the baby underneath his parent's bed***
***sid is the one who finds it dead in the crib***
*one day sid the science kid learns about SIDS*
yeah
SIDS only applies to children less than a year old
and frankly im concerned
i dont think that is the proper response
**SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME**
did you know there is something called
also
***i aspire to be him everyday mate***
**jesus christ**
**just from him**
**that's about three murders per year**
**160 murders**
im not sure what is supposed to be depicted within these hieroglyphs but im scared either way
*sorry?*
im confuzzled
this seems like gibberish
or maybe the fact there was excessive emoji usage
maybe the fact the letters arent in any coherent order
something tells me it wasn't
wow
what the heck
im gonna disappear for 13 minutes
also
she's still nine you sicko by the way
right
erm
banana-y...
im proud
im leaving it there actually
i know
i did not put that banana there

she added something
my sister messed with my handsome bois folder
god dang it
thank you?
what is it
i'd rather get shot
i would just refuse
why did you draw it at all
jesus christ

Dark energy, believed to be causing the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, provides a constant outward force that does not dilute as the universe expands. Pitted against this relentless push is the gravitational pull from the rest of the matter and energy in the universe. Early on, the universe was much denser than it is today, and the attractive force of gravity was winning the battle, on scales both large and small. Clouds of gas condensed to form stars and galaxies, and galaxies drew together to form clusters. If there had been more matter around, the universe might have started to recollapse before it ever had the chance to accelerate. But matter and energy do dilute as the volume of the universe increases, so dark energy slowly came to dominate. Since about six billion years ago (about a billion years before Earth formed), the expansion has, on average, been accelerating.

**i refuse to stop**
i would argue many good things
are you sure about that
alrighty
aaaaaaaGHHHHHHHHHHHHH
and now i want my dad's cookies
sometimes you think wrong
you just dont think you are
and now you are dead
just five seconds?
that sounds like a problem
oh dear
something tells me you're not dead completely
**biggest oof**
change in member count
***aHA***
aha
i just dont want to stop you all from having any fun is all
i'll try not to argue with you on that point
aw thanks
it would at least be better for me
we aren't really doing anything from what i know
tomorrow would be better
alrighty
dont let me stop you
you all can do something today if you want to
any other days i wouldn't feel so bad for it cause their schedules usually arent filled
at about 2 my parents will get home and have food with them and frankly i feel a bit mean messing up what is already a busy schedule so suddenly
i dont see many practical ways around it
i've been trying to convey if you want me there at whatever we may be doing today really isn't good
but by all means expect me not being able to come
i have no clue whether it is a fifty fifty shot
but that is a very big maybe
i'll have to talk to my parents about that
i have to watch my sister for three hours or more
im really not that open today
but frankly if you haven't noticed, jabob, physical activity isn't exactly my thing
that is a terrifying thought ben
yeah on sundays its open between 8 am and 2 pm
alrighty
ah
i'd have to talk to my parents about it, i'd much rather just go tomorrow though

that would be impractical for me

that sounds incredibly stupid

how?
while it is still going zoom
fly a kite out of an airplane while its high up
wouldn't that make it a bit stupid to do?

it goes zoom in the air real fast
you do understand what a plane is right?
somehow I doubt it is

the california road trip comes first
as much as I love the idea
that's why we should be confined to the U.S
I know
cause it would turn out like no on me expected
which is what would make something like that so fascinating
this friend group is terrible at planning
we make it up on the go and make stupid decisions along the way
I think we all agree that chaos by now its basically part of the plan
getting arrested in a foreign country sounds less fun than getting arrested in America
the road trip is a priorty
it would make for sooooo many good stories later
how expensive could it possibly be
I mean
weeg
the friend group but the road trip is around the world
I probably have
I feel like I have
have I talked about this before

I doubt that
you can never take this away from me
haha
I'm taller
it doesn't matter
**it does even more if you used me as an excuse**
**oh but it does**
**shorter**
it must be a disease
genetics can't explain you
i mean
and guess who is shorter?
some historians speculate he was actually above average
Napoleon actually wasn't short it was a combination of English propaganda and bad conversions between measurements
Napoleon is my dad

suicide bombing?
if an army of sams rise up suicide is the only way out for me
suicide seems like a good solution
they've already laid eggs
there are more sams out there

**Sam energy**
from a one to ten how would you rate your experience?
I met with a witch doctor underneath a bridge in l.a. and she gave me a mixture for my abortion
it was a mixture
same
it was not done by a professional
I poisoned the baby
bamboozled my unborn son by aborting him in the third trimester
that would sure be one bamboozling
if I was a pregnant female I would get an abortion on april first spontaneously for chaos
**BAMbOOZLEd OnCE aGaIN**
A YEAR AGO I REVEALED I WAS STRAIGHT THE WHOLE TIME

we grew so close she even included all her physical and liquid assets to me in her will

I ONLY FOUGHT IN TWO
I DIDN'T FIGHT IN FOUR BATTLES
well guess what
I'll have you know I was a respected doodlesniper in both the boozlewar of 1897 and the bamwar of 1912, and I went through all four battles of the Doodleville Slaughter
I have won more boozlebattles than your mere bamdoodle brain can comprehend
I am the superior bamboozler

pineapple isn't that good
due to my body now being an enormous green orb
confined to a single space
I ask this question as i lay here
what are the benefits of being a pineapple
now we mustn't make any rash decisions
it's certainly a commitment
are you sure about that?
oh
those youngsters should know that wearing pineapples duct tapped to them is just wrong
with their extreme wear

I just got a really intense ad on fashion design
exactly
it's legal to break out of prison in germany

and painful
I know what I'm doing tomorrow for sure now
why haven't I thought of this before
this is perfect
aha
my dad actually has an old dusty probably out of tune guitar he got in alaska
I will
**I can learn to play Home**
we are learning how to play guitar in music
I just had a revelation
also
fair enough
your definitely going to be the one getting the death penalty
all I have to say is
well
in more ways than one
slightly illegal
indeed
just because the acid can dissolve bodies doesn't mean that's its sole purpose
you could find it
dissolving the bodies in acid
we are going full breaking bad
no need
I was thinking the same exact thing
I'm sure you have a plan on how to get a job like that
fair enough
wow
stuff has to be approved
which makes it unlikely of such a thing ever happening
it's all a bit vain and in bad taste though
and it would fulfill one of my goals to go down in Wikipedia somewhere
to the book in question
publishing a book at a young age would be a massive marketing boost
which is why I've said quite a few times like I feel I'm letting the years slip away
for book writers
my fantasies usually involve me gaining notoriety from writing a book at a relatively young age
so it'll be more likely to stay a sad hobby and a what if
however language arts isn't quite as stable or financially rewarding
and I enjoy it
I have a knack for words and I've gotten really quite good at recognizing words and reading and such
if we are being unrealistic something literature involved
engineer or physicist
safer job guarantee financially
the realistic option would be to take something heavily math related
something in the academic field I excel at
or cactus tamer
like squid wrestler
I'd prefer a legitimate answer because I'm actually curious but if you hand over an original joke in place ill give you a pass
do you have anything in mind?
what do you want to be when you grow up
I have to be amazing and best everyone at living
don't

I'm begging

OH RIGHT
I don't even remember what his original intention was with the word perfect
I'm not sure
i don't understand how he could've even thought saying perfect at that moment was okay
I know
food for thought
Sam has said multiple times he is or wants to be little pig boy
also
I'm more willing to this time
bad idea
ignore that also

I should've gotten a screenshot of that
I did have bad anxiety beforehand which could also be related to over thinking

the way I drift off when a bit lost in my own distress
if I had half I brain I should've realised that
cause it took me wayyy too long to notice such a simple thing
duck sock things
anyways
I'm an idiot
it explains spirals and everything else

DANNY AND ARIN PLAYING CHESS
YES
ahh
how many have died at said tea parties
oh
I can very much see that
I thought there was only one left
hm
you have a misshapen perception of time
that's demented even though the dude turned out to be a terrible human being
"Don't drop the soap."
JESUS XHRIST
"He's working hard on that new prison role play series"
"do you think he said 'what's poppin it's jinpop' when he went to jail"
"Burn in hell"
someone putting it more bluntly
or
"When's the Prison Break series coming out?"
"he'll be out in no time"
"don't worry guys, he played minecraft cops and robbers"
stomach turning
that's
jinbop?
oh?
that's a bit excessive
also there are 160 do not laugh videos from skydoesminecraft
I can only watch so many videos at once
stampylonghead was better
I actually don't remember anything much about him
and hope he burns
I hate him
this is the reason I do drugs and cut
god
all his most recent uploads
now
I loved him
I was really into him
this is genuinely upsetting
he's doing fortnite now
my childhood has been ruined
stampylongnose
stipid phone
even for a youngling
small you had seriously bad taste
six years ago that was made
jesus
apparently people find it a lot more nostalgic than I do
"Where men cried."
the top comment is just
this is one of the few I can listen to without dying
this is too large a rift to seal
I don't think we can be friends
I listened to it way too much
fallen kingdom was my favorite man
small you is seriously stupid
you are ducking dead to me
it is a bit nostalgic actually
"My childhood hurts"
saying how this triggers their nostalgia so bad
all of the comments are from about a week ago
I'm looking back at the comment section of Fallen Kingdom
you must have a problem then
my god
it's a lot worse than I thought it would be
hence
I didn't think it would be good
it's a lot worse than I thought it would be
I'm gonna lose myself in minecraft parody songs
WoAh
woah
**you biased bamboo tree**
that's the unimportant bit you biased bamboo tree
a new Daniel Thrasher sketch is out
I think it should
should the topic end with that?
god
no one wants Let Me Taste Your Milk Man as an employee
his public reputation is ruined
his wife leaves him, takes the children and fortune he worked so hard to build
his whole life is torn apart
their permanent mark on the internet there
that is what they will be remembered by
**NOW LET ME TASTE YOUR MILK**
the hell
oH
oh
for the advancement of male lactation
oh?
which explains the unnatural lactation
he has like a tumor and hormone imbalances
he must be so embarrassed
this poor dude

**for the advancement of male lactation**
where does it take you?
this has 1.9 MILLION views
that dude actually made milk
woah
just
WOw
thats
ahem
I didn't notice sjrhej

I need to pin it

I didn't think I'd be spending my first days as a teenager like this
I have to say
time to look it up anyways
phew
it won't work on my ipad
oh jesus
YouTube videos is a link
there is a link
w hat have I walked in on
what
"I've even found some YouTube videos of men squeezing milk from their nipples."
"'I might be able to do this,' I thought to myself."
god this is
skip
blah blah blah
"Given the challenge before me, I was pleased to learn that the production of breast milk was a relatively simple process."
but what if I could bear one to suck at my bosom?"
"I know I can't birth a child myself,
"I'm 33 years old and single in New York City, a cross between Carrie Bradshaw and George Constanza - if there's such a thing as a male biological clock, mine has started ticking."
"The more I learned about male lactation, the more curious I became."
skipping some stuff
"I wasn't there on a mission for a pregnant wife or girlfriend."
"You don't see many men in the lactation section of Buy Buy Baby, but that's where I was when I bought my first breast pump."
Man Milk: My curious quest to breast-feed.
no joke
these dudes are trying to breastfeed
nah
MAN MILK: IT'S REAL
the name of this article from WIRED
wow
I use that stuff as a kind of soother
the mountains of black mail
I really hope a hacker doesn't find what I've been looking up
that was the hardest I've laughed in a while
god
you learn something new everyday
weeg
they were desperate enough
I mean they were starving
did any of them try their milk?
my one question is
AND THESE MEN ARE LACTATING IN PRISONS
65 MILLION DEAD FROM WORLD WAR TWO
TTHOUSANDS DURING THE WORST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY
THOUSANDS SHELBY
I'm at Ibffnssj
DURING WORLD WAR TWO THOUSANDS OF MEN REPORTED LACTATION WHILE HELD AS STARVING, MALNOURISHED PRISONERS IN CAMPS
I'M ACTUALLY READUNG THE ARTICLE
JSNEWNSMSKSLDLLDSLEKMESJ
lactating men
errr
but now you have
I don't know what from there
and boom
starve them until they lactate
keep males in there
get a dungeon
easy
and that came up
I searched up man milk
I'm not joking
it's real
yup
this is real
my god
I think it's one of the few actual ways
**One way to induce lactation from men is via starvation**
SJUSKSWKRVJELWWKJQANALALNW
this all sounds so wrong
**jesus christ**
WE CAN GET HOLY MILK YALL
IS THE POPE A GRAN
BETTER IDEA
WAIT
is president milk extra valuable?
and I apply the suck?
does that mean I apply the tubes to trump
WAIT
wait
if so what best product to use for milking
is trump a gran
dumb question
by the way
true art
im enlightened
im not confused
look at what you did
I expected worse cause you built it up
not that bad
YOU WANNA FIGHT
more than you have
I've seen terrible things
it can't be that bad
well now I need to know
I need five ted cruz ones
I forgot what I was doing
ahem
nor should they then comment on how much they laughed at their own joke afterward
no one should laugh at their own mediocre joke like that
god im gone
im making myself laugh too hard

but clearly fate hates me
stop talking before you send me spiraling into a crisis
before my phone died
I was about to say

beforehand I was talking to myself and making jokes about airpods
I genuinely laughed in a way I never have at my own jesus choked on an airpod joke
and neurotic
I'm really giggly all of a sudden
indeed
jesus christ those memes
**jesus choked to death on an airpod**
I still hold fast
didn't think I'd see religious statements like that on this discord out of all of them
night
but god isn't real yo
you can believe what you want to
he choked on an airpod

ya know
he can't love you if he is

it was not a good idea
he snorted alcohol cause he was bored

I eat those things

I wish to snort dust
my internet is going wacky and this crappy phone makes it hard to type

that sloop was very quickly buried

I unfortunately don't have a nose anymore
poor nose
truly showing off your class
ain't?
such a sickening statement
unhonorable
I'm  seven thousand above you
I'm pretty much on top forever by now
I'm painting along with various condiments
my tongue fell out
alrighty
that's
Jesus Christ
you should see the world
start up minecraft
drag ancient structure there
inside there is the saves file
inside Appdata Roaming you will find a .minecraft file
just Google how to access appdata folder
you still with me?
it should come up
just search for 'run' in the search bar at the bottom right hand corner
a way to bypass this is to use the run application Windows devices have
on most computers and stuff it's hidden
do you know how to get to your appledata thingy folder to get to .minecraft?
do you know what you're doing?
I think I have a better question
have you tried moving it to your .minecraft saves folder?
why are you clicking that stuff though
also how is it not working?
güt sloop
I've forwarded it to you Shelby N as well
I sent it ideoso
I've emailed it
have fun
congrats
wait a momento
wait a momento
yes
quickly
who wants my dirt temple map
so you all can explore yourselves
i've gotta send the map
i know
in all its glory
look upon it
but
its happens
my dirt temple
and a loss of both of my legs
it only took six hours of back breaking labor
ITS FINISHED
MY GOD
bye
maybe
**i cant stop**
which probably adds to the time
and i take the dirt from far away as to not interrupt the landscape of where my temple shall be built
i've been not taking the top layer off
well i've filled my inventory a few times
putting it in a chest
just collect dirt
i havent been counting
i dont know
**too much**
it'll be glorious
yeah pretty much
five
yup
at last the dirt collecting is over
**aha i am half way done collecting the dirt for my dirt temple**
you have problems
***but stop maybe***
***she is nine yes***
maybe think before you propose such scenarios
yeah
no
i dont think i want that
not to my computer
to my door
its hard to buy new legs if you cant get up to buy them
**im trying**
i cant move my legs anymore
baby tads but they are weaponized
**YES**
the tad family
the tad race
**im only four hours into the twenty eight lads**
im like half way finished
yup
**yes**
you know what
i should probably take a break from making my dirt temple
Im PlAyInG MiNeCrAfT
my eyes were stolen by the grombles
we all are
and hence the fact its talking about a demo launch
hence the fire and smoke
its a spaceship taking off
**its heaven**
time for a 28 hour session of minecraft
w o w
strangely no one in my family has questioned the fish taped to my wall
wOaH
good for you
cold rain indeed
in fact it is part of the nuclear winter that is now consuming the earth, there will be crop failures and mass starvation around the globe for at least ten years due to it!
it isnt!
you think that is snow kids?
that seems more likely
what is snow
yup
conversation shall resume
the sacred minute is over
everyone take a moment of silence for our fallen comrades in the great meme war
it is the sacred minute ladies and gentlemen
duh
its minecraft vs roblox candy challenge
alrighty
I can't wait to be awoken in the middle of the night by the freaking fish ripping free of his bonds and falling to the floor
and it gave me a much deeper appreciation for the game
this is what made me fall in love with it in a completely different way
in fact I'm going to rewatch it now
and I think it's almost 100% correct
but I found it very interesting
it's lengthy
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6bMn4CoyUkM
oh well
make
when you watch this video that makes everything make a lot more sense
you'll know what I'm talking about
and
which was one of the more pure ones
Edith died in childbirth
Lewis killed himself
Milton ran away
ha peasant
I need to replay
I'm not sure though
kinda a shrine
dawn had something relating to an indian relief effort disaster
in the classroom I think it is
if you look around enough
sanjay was just the husband who got briefly mentioned
nah
it's subtle
Sanjay was killed in relief effort in India I think
oh yeah Sven was crushed by dragon
Dawn due to illness
Gus was killed by shabby wedding tent in storm
Gregory drowned
bucked off by buck
Sam was more obvious
sad really
then hit by a train the minute he stepped out
hid underground
Walter witnessed enough of it to be scarred
possibly accidentally by boyfriend
Barbara was murdered
yeah
it was the poisonous holly berries
weeg
Molly I didn't figure out on my own cause I'm a dumb dumb and her strange sequence shocked me more than anything and I wasn't focused on solving things
if you remember she mixed alcohol with her medicine in that ending sequence
edie basically poisoned herself
odin drowned cause the whole house thingy
I'll start down from the family tree
at first I saw it as bad luck too
how true are the stories?
is there a family curse?
well either way what's your interpretation of events
HOW MUCH OF THE STORY HAVE YOU GOT PIECED TOGETHER
SO SO SO
MMMMMMMMMmmmmMMM
I WOULD PAY MONEY JUST FOR THAT BIT
THE CONSTANT BORING HABITUAL MOVEMENTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE FANTASTICAL CHARMING UNIVERSE HE CREATED
THE LEWIS SEQUENCE WAS GAME MECHANICS TELLING A STORY PERFECTED
I KNOW
odd connections
I know
yes
how are you able to make these connections
that's enough to kill
I mean look at the water level she put him in to begin with
that death was entirely Kay's fault
I love parental neglect
that one was messed up too
it's fine
it was a moment of pure inspiration
which gave me the idea to say that
so I angrily scratched near my eye
I got a strong itching feeling near my eye
I entered my password wrong
I don't know
I nearly ripped out my eyeball due to frustration
I should be able to enjoy staying up
its the weekend though
the reason I fell asleep last night earlier than usual on a weekend is cause of tad
you do know more comfortable things make you sleepier like that right
cause tad is comfortable and lovely
I'm not tired?
erm
I'll have to apologize later
by move off I mean throw
I had to move tad off my bed cause otherwise I would be asleep by now
yay
oh?
a refresh
it's not that big a deal
just restart
CAPITAL TEXT INSTEAD OF REGULAR
OR RATHER
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING ABOUT THIS
I know
just downsized
like strawberry but with tiny ninja stars and the whole outfit
ninja gear but for fruits
OoooH
now I'm going to deliberately put a lemon in my room in plain sight out of defiance
I have the sneak ability of a lemon
it's upstairs
aaaAAAA
I want to play ck2
that's some interesting propaganda
oh dear
I want to believe
it's probably fake
but
the nazis were crazy
I mean
I actually have no idea the validity of that image
the reich really got everyone in
real nazi turtle

noight
Nazi Turtles
Hitler wouldve won the war would he have had a pet tortle
you can win everything via turtle
**via turtle**
I take back everything I said
you are living the superior life style if you have found that before me
awwwwwww
I think you can learn how to set up a playstation
the internet
you know how?
I think im going to teach myself physics tomorrow
you could learn anything and everything
you have the internet at your finger tips
you're a lost cause
you really want that?
bada bing bada boom
then you will know
just ask and learn
Neanderthals, contrary to popular belief, were incredibly intelligent when compared to homo sapien
how hard is it to set up a playstation?
also
once you get playing I won't bother you until your finished
welp
I want to vomit so much out and then send the video
the game mechanics interwoven with the story in such an elegant way
it still does
the lewis story was so expertly crafted game wise it actually amazed me
the best sequence of a game I've ever played is in What Remains of Edith Finch
also good job
little door thing?
why are you hiding your misspellings
***MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM***
mmmmmmMMMMMMMMMm
just
it's by far one of the best games I've ever played
and I've had a resurgence of love for it
I recently watched an analysis video of it
it's not that long at all
please
what have you figured out so far?
really most of them are tragic though
sad one
Walter was it?
ahhh
where art thou in thee game?
you finished What Remains of Edith Finch right?
then gave up
and I made a hole about an inch deep
and I dug
I dug
I was on an adventure to the center of the earth
byee
I am back from the depths of the Earth
aHA
wOaH

**oh jesus**

but the back is priceless
explicit images
let's just say
however she hadnt looked it over and it contained
it was gifted to me a few birthdays ago by my grandma
I found this book while nervously pacing the basement like a madman
yes
aha
now I have to look back and see the stuff I was gonna say
is the meme train over?
insert hypocritical nerd insult here
they are most certainly gay lovers
choppy things indeed
starting as far back as the franks
they also forget that the french empire throughout history was a power player in europe
permayhaps night
possible night
alrighty
ill have to look for more like that
I know
I should show my dad that on father's day
that's brilliant
but I found a book I forgot was gifted to me
sorry to interrupt the stream of memes
I blame it on my english and german blood
I hate the french
very accurate
french sniper got him
oh yes
the unsung heroes
this they do opposition
I'd like to use a pizza cutter against a bayonet
*classic*
wow
literal sharpened sticks are better than their noodle army
this must be why they had a hard time fighting against ethiopians
**it's all too accurate**
wow
**I love it**

hm?
anyways
I worked very hard on it
the fish looks like I'm putting it through some kind of medieval torture
indeed

unfortunately not
with extra support
the fish is back up laddies
alas I shall have to use extra support
My fiSH FELL AND IT FREAKED ME OUT
you're my hero if so gus
it's more than okay
I'd like to say I was a victim of like a drive by shooting or I was hospitalized during a spontaneous bear hunt
I need more pictures
I love it
you can barely see the tape
it looks like it's floating cause of the low quality
which first one?


I GOT IT
weeg
I'm being held hostage
run now
run
like it's screaming
I want it to be the first thing you see when you go into my room
it doesn't like it's picture taken
in its eyes
the pure fear



woah
let me send a picture of the said fish so you can understand
**I'M LIKING THESE IDEAS**,
*THERE YOU GO*
any suggestions?
I'm trying to glue a scared fish to my wall
also I'm awake now if you couldn't tell
sounds like my style of ruling
y e a g
I just accidentally pinned your message
my nonexistent fingers slipped
ignore that

then look at the current conversation
then realize otherwise
and read the first message I see as the current conversation
I pop back into the land of the living
sometimes I do that too
weeg
tad makes it hard to stay awake
I doubt it's time
your literally just a few years over 10
I was about to say
oh ok
sorry
we aren't creating any new roles
**12 hours is 12 hours too long**
time to end it all
oh
this magical minute will last forever
11:11
woah
you already have that
definitely the latter
reasons like this are the reason your not in a position of authority gus
no
gus
I suggest you delete it or edit it
not even correct grammar
yup
I ATE LIKE TWENTY DINO NUGGETS
a bit off topic
weeg
steven
the more boring one
nah the other one
you were gilgamesh?
brutal competitions between children that only end with one survivor
back in my day we only had blood sports
back in my day instead of a basketball we used the severed head of a local nobleman
interesting
did you plant a bomb
I have shot quite a few hoops in my time sonny
aha
it's really lovely
if I woke up at the right time I just stare up at it for like minutes appreciating it
during the morning yellow sunlight usually comes from that one window and it is like a beam that stretches across my room
my bedrooms only window in fact
I put him near a window
it gives general ideas
weeg
I watered him a wee bit
nope
let them die
bad
good job on having your behavior play perfectly into my joke ~~or I could tell~~
that's what I expected
good job on using opposing pronouns in order to emphasize the enigmatic nature of David's gender
also I have perched david atop the windowsill that overlooks my bedroom
oh god
**27**
i need like ten seasons

i unfortunately am also a furious victim of that fiendish finger snatcher
time to disappear
alrighty
my dad's gotta get dressed
two is two too many
im disturbed by the amount of people with gus as their profile picture
id rather kill myself
aha I have new glasses
*I can't stop thinking about plants*
so I'll just go to sleep I guess
anyways if I keep talking like this I'll look crazy and fill the discord with meaningless messages
like ferns with boots
I find something incredibly funny about ferns with human attributes

**wow**
w ow
thats perfectly fine
thats good
but writing in a persuasive type of way would be mighty unhelpful in this particular situation cause its suppose to be more in the way of informational
"im doin like a persuasive type of ordeal"
i read that last sentence in a wild western kinda voice and it was perfect
"While the concept of unmanned vehicles has been around for a long time, the use of them commercially and for personal use is incredibly recent. Unmanned aerial aircraft have been used throughout history for a variety of uses, from balloons being used to carry bombs in 1849 to the first commercial drone permit being issued by the FAA[1][2] (Federal Aviation Administration) in 2006. To understand drones better first we need to know where they came from and where they are going."
like
i wrote my paragraphs semi formally
i probably wouldnt put that
just add a paragraph over how the pros and cons relate to the current world
i cant do your work for you
that would be helpful indeed
sure
remember to add at least one picture
as long as you think they are sufficient that should suffice
how long are they?
do you have nice paragraphs?
ah
sheets, slides, docs?
what format are you using
what about it?
hm?
either use brute force or actual memorization techniques
just memorize them
no you
i should probably actually try now though i guess
i got 75% on the first try
my headache has been cleared after a quick lobotomy
aha
im going to disappear a few moments to clear my headache
indeed
yup
by the way the above bunch of bumbling, bombastic baboons are beset upon us bearing only bananas

ah

he died to cancer before he reached 70
zoom is dead
i come bearing the worst news
also
its too powerful for my mortal eyes to comprehend
wo w
woag im back from the land of the 9th century
you dont know that
that would be lovely because I don't remember which slides I'm presenting
lovely peppa videos
we are also presenting in Geography too right?
I don't remember what slides I'm presenting in science which is fun
güt
how could you
alrighty
thirty pages left
that was a second ahead of my alarm
I'm such a rebel
BAM
I'll stay for thirty minutes next time
farewell
I shall gleefully with gusto
but I shall see thee again, woolly mammoth
it calls me once again

I am simply a glitch in the simulation
I blame my slowness on the phone and a tired and stressed brain
I was about to say that before you did
**extra reinforcement**
what are you gonna do with a spine?
wow
**sliding towards you is his entire spine**
you hear a clattering behind you and you turn around just in time to see a man crumple to the floor with a groan
but it's just part of growing up
sometimes my spine just kinda slips out
pat yourself vigorously on the back
good job
that's a good wooing then
stop the wooo
this is really effective considering everything
and 61 pages left
STILL ALIVE
HAHA
indeed
if I survive the riot
**ill be bach**
what a wonderful thing to leave off on
that's fifteen minutes
welp
me in a prison riot
hence
it's ruined my life kinda
im trying to stop drugs
which should be easy enough
I just have to not fall asleep
woo indeed
so
I get about thirty read each half hour
I got only a hundred pages left
oh year
now instead of repressing my intense longing for potted plant status I can scream about it on discord
in all seriousness this actual system of reading and breaks is helping my sanity incredibly
well the hitmen were tracking his phone cause a slip up
yerp
his mom must've accidentally called his dark web phone and got them all killed
you should've known better
I assume you already have funeral preparations
also is gus dead?
i don't like this one bit
even if it's a small amount
in fact I implore you to spend time differently
you don't have to give me a present
ya know
I don't like this
shrubbery?
but I wanna be a potted plant
I don't know why that is suddenly so appealing to me
I would love to become a well treated potted plant
you know what would be perfect
also I've gotten used to it
or rather 13 now
I estimate 15 minutes till I get clubbed
the guards are a bit preoccupied
a riot is happening
oh no it's not that
for 15 minutes
I am back
haha
time to go back
well my designated time limit for conversation with people outside of prison is over
goodnoot
spoiler alert I die in infinity wars
I'm on my phone m8

I dream of that every night

terrible things you want
but you didn't really wanna live anyways
it's kinda like learning your family has a history of genetic terminal cancer
*great ideas*

time to hopefully slip peacefully into that good night
I'm an idiot
I can't do this
I've given up
it was pleasant
I dreamt of, after a series of frustrating events, literally throwing myself in front of a semi
I fell asleep again
um
wow
oopsies
I read less than forty pages then fell asleep
I realize no one is on but
i wanna kill myself
welp
indeed
in a game
no
I should get to reading
anyways
at least that was what the mod said it was
you can collect bloodlines by consuming members of that specific bloodline
oh dear
there is actually a mod for that
Zoom should try and eat the pope
pope francis is a progressive pope though
medieval times
different era
nah son
not much with the peasantry
actually Zoom is quite popular in Germany
to answer your question they were different popes evan
twice
Zoom murdered the pope
oh?
amazing alliteration
but Zoom ate his twelve year old daughter
I won't judge
no
no
**¿adulterer murderer and cannibal?**
*what*
that won't change the fact he is mortal
he is great
but
although he is a prolific adulterer, murderer, and cannibal
he is a wonderful man
I love Zoom
but he will
what if he does die though?
I reckon he won't make it to seventy
he's about fifty Shelby
but he is aging
I wish he could
zoom has cancer
there is no good way to put this
um
you see
well
quite a few places are still depopulated
we are still recovering from the black plague
Zoomtopia
and replace it with
but then I'll destroy the title
I'm going for the Holy Roman Empire next
weeg
Zoom has a bloodlust
I killed at least five more now
he has killed more people
long may he reign
Zoom has been crowned as King of Germany
but that's beside the point
that ill have to take again tomorrow
it's a fifty fifty gamble
maybe not
maybe
I'm resting a few moments to give myself a calm before the storm
weeg
I am back before I partake in the torturous undertaking of reading 150 pages tonight
good bye lads
i shall never be back
i extended it
yup
it only records the last thirty days
also
its cause its a wee bit screwed up now
let me check
you may have
s? top
my strategy is to keep all the stats as low as possible
**102 years**
an adulterer, murderer, and cannibal named Zoom is now the King of Germany
also i can see the audit logs i can see when you delete things

dont abuse powers
oh yeah by the way no random deleting guys
not bijumbis
it says Bijumbis though
look back and it'll make sense
instead of you
thats why she said he
weeg
no one said that?
i dont actually doubt it
just to keep my sanity im going to assume you are joking around
whats that even suppose to mean
infuriating
its
i know
thank god
18
there you go
freaking 17
ugh
i think we all know its a bad word
she is deriving meaning from what was a meaningless situation
it wasnt even implied
it wasnt said
i dont understand
ben has done nothing to you
we need to start censoring you
god i love the game
**i wanna be cannibal buddies with someone**
**same trait opinion +25**


we all have our flaws though
*you should be*
all too soon...
taken out of this world too soon
poor spilt chocolate milk
drink it before it evaporates
quickly
delayed guten tag
bye
accurate expectations and such
I'm very careful with all that
I know
I expect nothing less
welc
weeg
it was amazing
I'm not even going to try and ironically play the straight man role
if I were you I would question my sanity a lot more often
you wore socks on your hands and your jacket as a mini cape yesterday
It seems slightly odd to question your sanity for just that future reason
I can't wait to see your very quick descent into madness as you wake up to Boomerang everyday
kill me
I woke up seven minutes before my alarm
actually do that peasant
he ate his twelve year old daughter
I shoved my uncle into a mega toaster
my mom lost a hand to one
it literally just vaporizes anything you put in it
weeg
**MY MEGA TOASTER**
behold
I should invest in a mega toaster
just take out my mini toaster and toast some mini bread
at all times
I have mini toaster
but don't worry
actually go
weeg
I want toast now
toaaaast
alrighty
o h
don't include the legs in
measuring tape
easy
which is the problem
actually you have plenty of room
shelby you have no room to talk
how
where did I go so wrong
several of my other children are short
has a harelip
which is my son's actual name by the way
Zoom Part 2 Electric Boogaloo
but Zoom was apparently a carrier for shortness
I don't know why the gene is with us
genetically
a bit of a failure
uh
is
his son
oh also
if I had the mod enabled for gods I would certainly try
so it gave me easy and fun dueling experience
then killed them in the duel
I challenged them to a duel
it wasn't straight up murder
that's really what I did
BUT THE CHILD MURDER HAD A REASON
those were just fun
not the pope ones
I HAVE A REASON FOR MOST
I was going to go for their child next but they already had the plague and they were one so they were basically already dead
most recently I killed one of my vassals husbands
I've killed at least a couple more in duels
I killed those two popes
I killed a fifty year old man cause he was upset with me
I killed some random eight year old greek kid
I had my wife killed
Zoom has killed a lot of people
now that I think about it
I know
Zoom doesn't like popes a lot
also Zoom murdered two popes
like nearly right after the other
to the plague
also a couple popes died
I've had the same council the past twenty years
bring in two new people
I had to completely rearrange my council
so many characters died
weeg
gotta look on the bright side
so
while I wasn't eating people, kicking my wife out the castle, I built a library in Zoomgard
she ironically enough was the only victim of the plague from the family, although it was indirect
*I cannibalized my twelve year old daughter*
this is what I was talking about when I said things didn't turn out ideal
ate her
uh
and
I caught stealing as well
and it also turns out I should have raised my daughter better
turns out greedy behavior just doesn't die
well
I ate him
so
I found some random dude stealing from our limited rations
that's not the half of it
well
true
so rats had to do
food ran a bit low
well
and
for five years the stone walls of Zoomgard were the only thing protecting the Jablonski family from total annihilation
we hid in our castle for like half a decade
mine was relatively fine
several dynasties were wiped out
I'm glad I downloaded the dlc
I have never seen such a wave of death in ck2 before
it was horrific
it spread from India to England
left my kingdom severely depopulated
the black death arrived
let's just say
but it's not the best possible situation
things haven't gone too bad
well
and
I played a bit more of the Jablonski family
also
so that's lovely
I finished some random low level reading counts book I have
understandable
**life is pain**
I just read over a hundred pages boi
holy pepperoni I have been resurrected from my shallow grave

surely a measly one hundred matters not
your confident in your abilities
well
you owe me a hundred if you dont though
go ahead then

probably
it doesnt for me

that would make more sense shelby
weeg

my parents arent even home now
i have no clue
at least for me
well its a bit late and all
next weekend?
so
thats what i thought
because all these suggestions are nice
will we still be doing something?
so basically there was no plan to begin with gus?
not shrek 3 though m8
jesus christ
**gus that wouldve been good to know sometime ago**
*actually have a plan for your own event gus*
it would be a lot more helpful if it was next weekend
tomorrow being monday
and its sunday
plus its four pm already
but i may not be able to come now that its such short notice
then i could actually get ready and have a loose plan
weeg
you should've specified a time yesterday
i dont know whether i can come anymore now
yeah
is it still going to happen?
jesus christ gus just give an answer
when the heck is the thingy you ideoso
ah
odd
surprising
101
***i didnt***
*oh*
she kicked herself to death
plot twist my sister just freaking died
*wowie*
plot twist, im actually *chinese yoda*
weeg
i took a screenshot of the insides but i think ill leave that up to you to look at yourself
weeg
those magical numbers
5482/72/-41
its such a beautiful build i wrote down the coordinates
its so refined
house

oh here is my favorite
*a true piece of history*

i found that a bit south of a nazi highway
i know
**make them load then**
this
there was also
erm
it had a lovely but depressingly small wall of stories
at 5308/107/-22
The Halfway Home

imbedded in it was a small home

about 5k blocks out i found a massive lavacast
but i will anyways cause i got time to burn
i dont remember if i sent these or not
and then back to the free cam overview
makes sense
ah
parent controls?
indeed
on top of the tower
for some reason there was a passageway underneath the church someone made
but the floor is alright now
and now im 162 place in queue
i was going to do more but then a crafting error booted me off the game
to show my dedication i rebuilt the floor

the church of feggism is in disrepair
and yes
PEASANT
HA
the church of feggism with bijumbis in the corner i only just noticed
i havent bothered checking for some time now
any chest you come across this close to spawn is empty
probably all stolen by now
erm
this is the wee house front
thats my favorite message from there so far



alrighty
ah
which you can see on the right
plus its right next to a main highway
its only about 6.4k blocks away from spawn so its gonna be a bit griefed
weeg
i was surprised
i know

The Eric Andre Show is the best talk show
**aaa indeed**
***you disgrace***

wait
and now I'm on the deltarune soundtrack
I need to rewatch it
weeg
oh kill me a piano cover of Carl and Ellies beginning Up theme is on
good job
aha
stop
just
why
comgrats
how insulting would it be if I gave you a box of way too many books that are deliberately too hard for you to read?
of course
you have a very lacking and very odd library
in every way
it's perfect
hedwigs theme I will forever love
oh dear
i eat boot
I usually don't even know what it is
to keep me fed during those I kinda shovel whatever is on the ground into my mouth
I already talked about my minecraft sessions
oh dear
*both*
it's lovely
wet hands
now I'm just listening to minecraft songs
I know
for it to be recommended
why did it take ten years
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6UklNu2NS4Q
I accidentally killed those thirty with a teaspoon
they are just bats
zero left
thirty bats came into my house
I may have a problem
erm
well
NLORDISV'M
THEY ARE ALREADY HRRE
I've already killed five
oh dear
I can kill a bat with a teaspoon
they are unentangled
WHAT EVEN IS HAPPENING WITH THEM
ALL MY WIRES ARE HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED
OH GOD
but fair enough
oh dear
thats a pretty lofty goal you got there
wow
wow
but he should be literally buried in pencils
ah clever
*I regret nothing*
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=buduC9hKP2I
Larry died sharpening a pencil
very
the hell am I watching
exactly
this is what matters
a wild bear hijacks conans show
oooh
weeg
ill try it
the breaks inbetween
but that's meant to keep the sanity isn't it?
but there's not much difference between locking myself in my room for hours and watching YouTube vs locking myself in my room for hours reading
I guess it keeps the sanity
I can read faster than someone can read to me though
I gotta look back at that pacing technique
MMMMmmmmmmmmmmm
an hour there to get ready for bed
thirty minute breaks
4 - 12
pessimistically thats
that'll be helpful
I can always stay up late reading
school tomorrow
not a full day of reading today
so that's what
it is a very nice safety net for my inevitable stupidity
I'd be screwed otherwise
at least we read the scarf girl
welp
I'm assuming it will be specified later
no
frickity frock frack
that cuts down time
there's also the seven thingy
ahhhhhhh
you have sworn wrong sworner
that's odd
was that the only book you had in mind?
carp
I don't wanna start reading laterrr todayyyyyyyyyy
of course
I forgot I had a birthday
ah frick
if I use correct reading and pacing tactics I should stay sane
I've done a hundred pages a day before
more so three
mmmmmmmm
I have about four days
the only book I am willing to read and definitely is reading counts is 373 pages long
makes sense
ah
otherwise the memories formed only last short term and are crushed by the tsunami sized wave of random information being converted long term
I have to take tests directly after the book for me
one book should suffice then
but my work in half
that makes life easier
the scarf girl book counted right?
not because I want to
and I dread every single moment I read because I have to
not out of necessity
but I read out of a need for enjoyment
I mean I read quite a bit and I have to say I'm quite a bit good at it
solely because out of the sixty odd books I have, only ten are viable
god I hate reading counts
perfect
when are reading counts due?
two hours down the drain
hurray
and I'm finished
also I'm watching parliament explode
they Iiterally just robbed you
very different
ah
oh shoot son 12 men with big puffy red hats just broke into my house and made me a cheese sandwich then left
alrighty
progress is progress

plus i have a hacked client
the server is too laggy to die to mobs
the whole time i havent seen a player
not much can kill me
not really
i need to travel a lot more for shoops

the 2b2t queue was only 77 people long
at least thats not how i perceived it
its not really awkward
wow
whats wrong with daves
do you expect good ones?
kill them then feast upon their grave dirt
only you could find yourself in that series of scenarios and come to the result of that
you're trapped only by yourself
that is an amazing goal
now im imagining it in the louvre
*wow*
i looked it up and sadly its not already a thing
i want a painting now of mr. clean nailed to a cross
jesus took the form of mr. clean during his time on earth

not my father You
as in you
not as in You
you are Yourself
I is the second cousin twice removed
who is I Me thinks you mean
so you can declare your hatred of him all you want
but he was a bit of a jerk
our great uncle Myself would be disgraced if he saw this kind of fighting
there
APOLOGIZE
now take back all the stuff you said about Me
thats right
im willing to take you on in a court of law
you made a personal attack towards Me
I don't know what your intentions could be
thats messed up man

we arent starting this again

shaven ducks are so much more
you are right

if you weigh as much as a duck you are made of wood
so logically
and what else also floats?
and what does wood also do?
witches are made of wood
but can't you also make bridges out of stone?
ah
but how do we know he is a witch?

minus the sign wall
and then the whole thing
this is entirely new

aha i have more 2b2t screenshots
ripperoni in pepperoni
i also had to explain what spleen juice is
i explained ahead of time i said that at one point
that wouldnt come as a surprise to my parents
the only thing i wanted was to blast that voice recording as loud as possible for my whole household to hear at 4 in the morning
that is extremely disappointing
**next will be a much better meal**

**you scare me**
i've been playing mount and blade for three years and i've only got 700
still distressing
thats 500 hours per year
that gives you a mediocre excuse at best
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
the whole five years?
how long has it been tracking on steam
how long have you been playing terraria?
and that scares me
your addicted ben
181
i must be better

HA
i have 42 games
jesus
*ha peasant*
almost four now
i've had my account for like 3 years
a couple years ago i didnt and i had like fifty dollars left over for the next year
im going to actually have to spend it now
i only ask for steam giftcards cause i dont know what else to ask for
sad
thats
i thought i got rid of it all
i've bought two full priced games and a lot of dlc
it keeps coming back
i've been trying to get rid of the money
i guess a few got buried
well from christmas i got like 110 dollars worth in steam giftcards
i had 45 dollars worth in steam giftcards i didnt know i had
*lovely*
also
no rules except anti cheat
weeg
the oldest anarchy server on minecraft
for 2b2t
im just one short
i still havent got all the achievements for that game
**murder**
**why do this many people want to play on this server**
im willing to tolerate 241
everything past 242 is absurd
everything is better now
now im 241
nevermind
IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF
IM IN PLACE 243 ON THE QUEUE
legitimate advice
everyone giving constructive criticism
pass around your suicide note
yeah
i have a weekend free
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8
right
group suicide
basically
its when groups of people kill themselves
im disappointed you dont know this
ben
erm
b! define mass suicide
im thinking a bridge out somewhere
so sunday or saturday?
i would love mass group suicide
bye
I won't ever be able to do that
it would cause a full on crisis
im scared of what mine would be
weeg
to see a pie chart for how I spend my time out of 24 hours
you know what I'd hate
god
really sleep shouldn't be that abnormal for you
yahh
worrying
that's
it's not entirely abnormal to act weirder and more like that after insufficient amounts of sleep
yeah
people tend to act more neurotic without sleep
I really don't think so
I would describe it as good but alright
almost everyone got good, healthy amounts of sleep
almost everyone then
truly a remarkable thing
wow
because the world is a twisted, *twisted place*
doing shelby kinda things
i havent the slightest clue what goes on inside your mind
ben is gone again
basically
not love
thats just the toxic environment shelby
i dont blame you
im sure he doesnt
god
thats actually a good one
wow
alrighty
you might have completely done that on purpose
actually
you're an idiot
gus
poor timing
thats
you definitely drove ben away there
you really have quite the obsession with the word slut huh?
you sound jealous
im an idiot
im so sorry ben
i shouldve lied
i shouldnt have said anything
except you of course
**literally everyone**
apparently
i dont know where you got that from
ben doesnt hate you?
it feels better than this
no
**p l e a s e j u s t m a k e s e n s e**
what do you have to gain from any of this
i dont understand your motivation anymore shelby
disgust*
you are so confusing
w o a g
really its shelby x everyone except shelby
my god
plus ben talks to shelby l more
i got there late and i didnt know what was happening
i didnt write down the names
do you understand how it works?
**we couldnt**
and actually be in a group
and i couldve suggested to combine those specific two
you and shelby couldve been two
and sam couldve been three
ben
me
because she combined groups of 2s and 3s
he screwed over our possible mega group
sam signed up with alex for some stupid reason
thats why
cause you already signed her up with you
but mrs. collier said that couldnt be done
and shelby's
mine
he wrote down his
when ben was writing down names for the groupy thing
with mrs. collier?
OOOH
woag
48
im not sure though
i dont think so
a shot in the dark really
i could be wrong
just a guess though
im willing to say they asked because of that
judging by the fact we were there for the groups
well
ben did too
sam asked about her
wat is it
those would be crappy codes

**black yoda**
lovely
bye
420
but
my previous night was much better
actually not really
this is the best possible timeline
I got about four hours and twenty minutes of sleep
I did the math and I'm very happy
but fun
inefficient and speculative
and sometimes interpreting dreams can be fun
we obviously know it connects at least a bit with reality
what they're purpose are
we don't know why they exist
dreams are just weird anomalies in general
at least for the beginning of the day
so that contributed to my mood as well
There was another dream after it I don't remember anything of other than it was less serious and sentimental and more funny and light hearted
by recent I literally mean anything the last two years
I'd have to say my dream is the purest recent dream I've had
it sounds interesting
weeg
he didn't play such a major part as gina did
the thing is though
I mean I don't know anything about Kyle and he was in my dream
that is a bit odd
especially if they are prevalent in your life
weeg it's a pretty common thing
was it like deja vu or different?
weeg
that's surprisingly chilling when compared to mine
wow
*wow*
oh that's cool
ah, alrighty then
subtle
God dang it peppa
I knoww
it just cut
I didn't have a response
and my dream cut off there
it was pure
is the pure childlike wonder that shone in her green eyes
and the thing I remember
but she takes it the wrong way in the most naive, there aren't any bad people in this world kinda way
and I make a sarcastic, rude, snide comment about the costume
so of course me being the terrible person I am kneel down to talk to her
and she was hopping around carefree
she was probably just dropped off from a kind of event
she was wearing this costume for some reason
there was this little girl who was maybe six or seven
the only part from me I remember
anyways
lots of speculation that leads no where cause dream timelines are useless but oh well
and later I came in once she had left
so maybe the girl stuff was just a precursor before I was there
but I have had previous dreams about the place where I was in it
now I'm not one hundred percent in this
the interesting part was when I came along though
weeg
just like how I'm sure those peppa pig videos are lovely
it was lovely in a way
almost as if she was recalling them flashback style just the funny stupid moments she spent messing around there
cause it was just snapshots
that part was interesting
anyways
wow
and this is so spectacular the girl I am **dabs**
somehow it lands upright without spilling any water
and when he flipped it I stopped it mid air, kinda blocked it with my hand and the cap flew off as well
I was nearby
plastic bottle in his hand
some kid was just sitting on a couch
then of course there was bottle flipping
one time these two brothers somehow flooded an entire room
I'm sure a lot of interesting and hilarious things happened, but my brain only remembered the least funny ones
someone I barely know
out of all people
I dont know why him
I distinctly remember Kyle being there
but it's perfect for making interesting scenarios
the place makes no sense
essentially it was a rundown, abandoned apartment building that a couple of parents dropped off their kids to let them screw around as they did other things
but it's the setting so I guess I have to try and explain it
now the place literally makes no sense
kinda left there
it's never elaborated on
I remember a conversation between her and her mother about an art program of some kind
but she was part of the beginning of the first dream
I don't remember the girls name
the dream makes dream logic but not real logic
exactly
otherwise I'm leaving now
you better
in any way shape or form
I don't think they reflected me at all
some trying to get into an art program no less
it's not an excuse I was literally a different person
but it was a dream and I wasn't me so it doesn't count as me dabbing
yeah
it was just a detail in a part of the dream that I've only mentioned cause it's real attention grabbing
no
after a bottle flip as well
yes
a different person dabbing
the dream also takes place in the exact same place and situation as one of my other dreams years and years ago
but at the beginning and middle I was some fictional character my subconscious made on the spot
but at the end I was definitely myself
I don't exactly have a dream journal so large chunks of the dream is missing
just some girl
I don't remember who I was initially
so I don't know how much that counts
I wasn't even me
in my dream
but I really did
thats why I said it
I know
YOU STOPPED
HAHA
seee
I dabbed in my dream
but it won't
and but it won't be the same
and that's true
and I can stop at any time
and I seriously doubt that
and oh dear how long is this and bit going to last
and that was an excessive use of and
and now my brain has decided to be awake as ever
and that was ten minutes
temporary good noot
either way
but I am sleepy so that may not happen
well if I don't fall asleep in ten minutes I'm going to call it a lost cause and probably come back
goodnoight
I should be sleeping so
anyways
got me in a good mood
I didn't mention it but I had a lovely dream last night
actually drifting off so it is a good idea
why
ahhhjHhhhhHHHHH
I don't want to but I want to
God I think I'm falling asleep
yup
so I could say I went to Venezuela
and said I'm back
walked back
walked over to the paper
said I'm going to take a quick trip to Venezuela
taped it to a corner of my room
wrote Venezuela on the paper
I took the pencil
tape
pencil
I had paper
well
I'm back from Venezuela
I'm gonna go on a quick trip to Venezuela
that is truly impressive
impressive
woag
I just freaking inject that stuff
I need my fix of dirt
it's a problem
I have a crippling addiction
I would eat dirt even if I wasn't a Mole Person
good
just be prepared to eat dirt
but sure
I don't know how much extra food I have
**the mole men**
I'm hiding underground like a Mole Man
indeed
**im not insane**
**but doing so might put me in the way of shaggy**

yahhhh
it wouldn't be good either way
weeg
that sounds like an excuse
jesus shelby
well thank god you didn't
why was there an open boxcutter on your bed
I like the server so far
but personally
though if you go exploring through that wilderness your sure to eventually happen upon a griefed and forgotten base
millions of blocks long
by then it's really unlikely to run into someone due to the massive map
once you get a couple thousand blocks out it should play like a normal minecraft game
well it's just spawn
**still 170 long**
I got back in queue
that was it
I lost connection
then
there was a new tnt crater in the side of the hill
I had a quick look around
on the walkway next to it
just outside the inn
I was back where I left off
I got on
and finally
I waited
but I was patient
around 300 people already on
170 long
there was that massive queue
so I tried to get back on today
then logged out
I left my own signs
I tried to replant the wheat farm but that was impossible cause **the land was stripped barren of all vegetation**
adding furniture to the inn
gathering resources
I tried replanting a few trees
of course I stayed there a little while
**this is hell**
then one just said
there was a few that was congratulating on how it helped them survive
people who have been there could leave comments and the date and their username
but there was also a sign wall
you know
well
there was also a banner inside the house that was just a crude drawing of
which hadnt been
and also a melon farm
which had been plundered
a little farm
there was an obsidian house
I was thoroughly surprised
but after what I saw
and by all means wasn't very lovely
wasn't much of an inn
I came across a lovely little place called The Inn of Hope
but after following a path for a little
along with the occasional massive pillar of cobble stone
it was evident by the lack of any vegetation and wild life
I was still close to spawn
and I found something very pleasant
and I went through a nearby nether portal
I decided to peak out
and after a few minutes of walking
I managed to find the main highway in the nether
and a few suicides
but after some trial and error
the nether is worse of course
navigating off a highway is a death sentence
so much tnt has been set off
those random pillars of cobblestone really do exist
of course scaled down
cause this is spawn

you know why
a lot
and I died
after a queue
I got on yeaterday
so
I think someone had a bot on loop just saying the same baby killing joke
there was so much things about killing babies in chat
this seems right up my alley
hey
so I thought
and there is usually a very large queue
nothing you make is guaranteed to stay due to griefing
it lags a lot
the spawn is inescapable
the chat is cancer
basically
people have built vast highways that run for millions of blocks
it's mainly used for transportation
it's even more destroyed
the nether isn't much better
that's assuming the portal isn't a trap that someone is waiting for you just to kill you
just so you can get out of there
most new players are recommended to try and get to a nether portal as soon as possible since every one block in the nether equals eight blocks in minecraft
once new players hop in they have to climb mountains and walls of cobblestone
nearly a decade of griefing at spawn
it's pure hell
oldest anarchy server on minecraft
remember I sent a video having to do with a minecraft server 2b2t?
**I a m e n j o y i n g t h i s**
so clearly it doesn't matter enough to be mentioned
then went downstairs
I got to place 88
now I'm not
and then I'm not
and explored it
so I just lay in bed
I had a train of thought that I thought (ha) should be expanded upon
I spent like thirty minutes face down thinking and ignoring the outside world until now
exactly
I like explodeded
explodied
okay?
erm
I don't think crying is the right expression there
that is excessive

unless you have particularly bland juice I see no need
in the spleen juice
why would you need flavoring when all the flavor is already there
thats just weird man
fresh and stale mixed together?
man that stuff is nasty
newborn and elderly?
I like it that way
weeg
well newborn is fresh
I'm no expert though
I think it's because the spleen juice has had time to mature
it's good stuff
I wouldn't blame you
it's just a preference
it's fine if its not
if you can I prefer the spleen juice of the elderly
before friday
as soon as possible
I need it asap
does anyone have any spare spleen juice?

add three to both sides to move that negative three
give me one of the equations

absolutely
in more ways than one
you certainly are sick
one ripe gran
or
an army of Jablonski clones numbering in the thousands
Who would win in a fight,
adieu
all hail the big ripe gran in the sky
goodnoot madam ravioli
OFFICIALLY
NOW
nice
wow
I'm sure you're feeling more angst by the minute
I'm sure such a thing is absolutely life changing and so much about you is going to change because of that simple fact of arbitrary dates and times
you're technically a teen
I have a comment or two to make
wait
what have I done
and it's a Monday
my gran I'm not gonna get much sleep
that's why I've had 42 different ipads
I got so scared of closing the video I just YEETED it across the room
I accidentally smashed the ipad
God dang it this is hard getting off marks video
goodnoot madam ravioli
I guess I should actually sleep no matter how amazing mark playing catan is
goodnoot
yup
seppuku
I got a fortnite ad
now I must slip into the infinite sleep
welp
she is on top of me
harder said than done
now I must stay up
see
I am
I didn't know she was in the room
randomly
she jumped right on top of me
wow
CHARLOTTE
OW
my metal mouth contraption is running up against the insides of my cheeks so much it's making indentations, sores, and drawing blood at times
I taste blood
he's gone
he's not even laying down
now I must stay awake for captain
I am
captain is here
I don't know I'm laughing pretty hard
I NEARLY FELL ASLEEP AT 2
I'M ACTUALLY AWAKE NOW
BUT ITS POSSIBLE
and I missed out
it might be taken down for a random reason
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
the video is more important
well
but this markipoo video is one hour and thirty minutes long
crap
ah
I'M FOAMING FROM THE EARS
AND DEFECATING
AND URINATING
AND VOMITING
I'M CRYING
I'M EXPLODING WITH EXCITEMENT
YES
MARK DID CATAN
I'm assuming it is
sticky note arrowwwwwww
oh nice
you don't understand
the second balloon challenge video is the best one due to that
PROBOSCIS
I gotta watch my markipoo faster
I skipped it
"his life f*king sucked"
"don't feel bad for him"
and then an Asian dude walking in saying
a man dying in a hospital bed
what a way to start an ad
wow
your legitimately insane
I don't even want to know
barbie vlogs?
um
I have a small city of barbie
I've watched the series
I play all of the barbie girl games
I listen to the gummibear song 24/7
**e x a c t l y**
this the language god spoke when conjuring the garden of eden
it's elegant
god
it's Dutch
it's not German
my dreams have been crushed my reality again
jesus
yup
I forgot to listen to barbie german thingy
"it's efficient though" is the most German response you could've had
truly the worst way to die
the third tube
why would you choose to inject it through that way though
Jesus Christ
my phone assumes by now its murder
see it's autocorrecting
milk gran
or
kill gran
Would you rather
*we have very different definitions of the word right*
Would you rather
or a would you rather game gone wrong
that should be on a personality quiz
my moral radar says that killing gran is worse than milking gran
also milking auto corrected to killing and I'm very concerned
anyways now it'll be significantly less funny for anyone scrolling up cause the grandma milking conversation has been buried
e x a c t l y
thank you
and if that's all they mean to me they can't be all too important
so half ego booster half practice for something
I only like them because they give me easy practice for confidence and quick smart responses
although I keep the thoughts alive because I don't see any harm they are doing
and frankly the way I feel about you and Socratic Circles is irrational as far as I'm aware
but they are mostly spectacle for people to see who is confident enough to lead, but also not stupid enough to say something that makes them look like an idiot
they are still a grade and all I think
they aren't as important as I'm making them out to be
or rather
Socratic Circles aren't that important
but do what you wish
every time I see you up there it hurts, I have to resist the urge to stop the whole thing and start over with a swift kick start or any kind of help for you
I just want to see a coherent and intelligent conversation from a Socratic Circle with you involved
I don't care if you have something special to share
by this point though
at some point
your a genuinely smart and generally creative person and I'd like to see a unique and smart viewpoint on a novel
that's not true
screw you
to try and find it again
alas I am too lazy though
couldve sworn I sent it
it disappeared
I came up with a response and everything
even I don't do that
why do you freak out like that
you just need to learn to calm down during those kind of situations
I'm not feeling up to it
and I'm sure you could explain it away in psychological terms but meh
it'd make my day
but I would love it
I don't know why specifically that
I just really want you to good in a Socratic Circle
however
I'll relent
Mrs. Walters encourages silences for people to collect their thoughts
you don't have to reply to things that fast
concise language
in rational
you have yet to explain to me why it's a flaming pit hecc
and the only one who can make it less awkward is you
and the only one who makes it awkward is you
**that is it shelby**
at worst it's awkward
if it's right it can produce legitimately interesting dialogue and increase your world view
nothing that bad is happening
it's more rational not to mind them
I for one am fine with, and in some cases even like those apparent pits of torture
also who said she was the only one who could make you?
aha you don't have large enough sums of money, plus it's Mrs. Walters I doubt basic bribery would suffice
aha not only would you not do that you also have nothing serious against her
you underestimate me
aha even in the unlikely scenario you leave your main friend group behind simply because of hell circles I'd still find a way
aha we both know you wouldn't do that
aha that's not allowed
you underestimate me
I'll find a way
I'd make sure you have a go
which is what would happen
you could go into the circle of hell without being properly prepared
or
yeah you might really want to do that
everything else is generally fine
a kind of blind spot
rape and crimes against children is just my weakspot
violence and murder are very easy to use distancing on
trying to find what you have in common with them is only going to make you more uncomfortable
serial killers don't phase because they can be simplified so much
i use distancing for violence
so I try to make myself more sympathetic in order to make them seem less threatening and therefore less uncomfortable
probably deep rooted problems
really they are troubled and obsessive people
for example I usually use humanizing with non-violent more passive stalkers
and they work better in specific scenarios
both can't work together obviously
the two tactics I use for eliminating uncomfortableness towards messed up things is A) Humanizing and B) Distancing
weeg
but very sickening
very useful evidence
but he wrote it down in a personal journal of his
I'll spare you the details
the story of this one dude who started when he was 13, and his mother or someone like that owned a daycare will stay with me a long time
yeahhh
listening to stories of pedophiles preying on like six year olds unsettles me
the thing that still does is crimes against children
listening to murders even if they are gruesome like that doesn't make me unsettled anymore though
it was a dude who was into her as well
yeah
but it was a bad area so I'm not surprised
a little frustrating it took the dad noticing the smell of a rotting corpse for him to finally find her as well
the blood splatters and all that
more interesting than anything
a twenty something year old girl bashed to death and then hidden under the stairs for weeks in the very house her father lived in?
it gets normal after a while
it doesn't make me uncomfortable anymore
but I hear enough about crimes and my dad's work I've become desensitized to most of it
no one wants poisonous spiders in their mailbox
plus it was just not a fun place to live
and it was a major factor in us leaving
I don't get much details but apparently things got bad enough he had regular nightmares about dying in the desert
I believe the time he first got shot at was there
my dad was a patrol officer in Nevada for sometime
I've kind of been numbed to most terrible things though
I make cancer jokes regularly
weeg
usually curable
thyroid cancer is extremely nonlethal though
having such a direct relative with cancer increases my own risk for it to appear later on a lot as well
but that stuff controls hormones and mood and that kinda stuff so if she doesn't take her meds it shows
luckily it was spotted early on so they could just remove the thyroid
minimal contact
when I was younger my mom got thyroid cancer and I remember her being confined to the downstairs bedroom
I guess it's just hard for me to relate to her cause I can't imagine getting really legitimately mad over a joke
but all that seems like an overreaction
well it makes sense
ahhhh that's what I thought
did she have a good reason for getting mad?
sweet cancer jokes
oh weeg
sixth grade was a real good year, for me at least
it was good in the long-term
I was crying man
yeah
it was a vicious cycle
I got loopier and loopier the more I laughed
so I laughed harder
which made me dizzy
and that got me less oxygen
again I was giggly
and that set me off a little for no reason
and I started hyperventilating
or just to entertain myself in someway
maybe a joke
I did the breathes for some reason
that's what happened
and I start hyperventilating
it doesn't take much
I feel like my lungs are killing me
so if I breath in and out irregularly a few times in big heaving breathes
and I have shortness of breath
i was already in a giggly mood
